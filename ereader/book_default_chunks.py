In years gone by electric lights, the\ntelephone and telegraph, not to mention wireless telegraphy, navigable\nballoons, and even our railroad trains would have been laughed at as\nimpossibilities. Yet to-day we have all these things, and many others\nequally wonderful, and each day we look forward to something even more\nstartling.\n\nIn the second place, I wished to draw attention to the fact that our\ncountry is growing with marvelous rapidity. From thirteen States we have\nmultiplied to several times that number, and our flag waves from the\ncoast of Maine in the East to the coast of Luzon in the West, and from\nAlaska in the North to Texas and Porto Rico in the South. What a truly\ngreat country it is, and what glorious freedom it grants to millions\nupon millions of people! In these days it is truly worth while to be an\nAmerican, and in the days to come the honor will probably be even\ngreater.\n\nThere is an ",
    'important lesson to be learned from all this, and I would\nthat every lad who reads these lines would take that lesson to heart.\nThe opportunities for boys and young men were never greater than they\nare to-day. The future lies with you, and you can make of it, and of our\ngrand country, what you will. The path to success is open to rich and to\npoor alike, and even the humble rail-splitter or the canal-boat boy can\nbecome President. Will you take hold of that opportunity or will you let\nit slip by?\n\nCaptain Ralph Bonehill.\n\n------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nTHE YOUNG NAVAL CAPTAIN.\n\n------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nCHAPTER I.\n\nTHE UNITED STATES AGAINST THE WORLD.\n\n"War is declared!"\n\n"Impossible!"\n\n"It is true. The news has just come by telephone from the cabinet\nchamber at Washington."\n\n"And against whom?"\n\n"Against the world!"\n\n"Are you joking, Andy?"\n\n"Oscar, I was never more serious in my life. The War Department has just\nsent the news to the office. The three new warships we are building must\nbe completed without delay. The firm is offered a bonus of fifty\nthousand dollars if we can float them complete by the first of July."\n\n"That is just six weeks off."\n\n"Exactly, and it means that four months\' work must be accomplished in\nthat time. We can\'t do it," and Andy Greggs shook his head doubtfully.\n\nHe was a tall, well-built fellow of eighteen, with blue eyes and curly\nbrown hair. He was a machinist, employed in the great Standard Shipyard\nof Bridgeport.\n\n"We can do it and we will," answered Oscar Pelham decidedly. "We can\nwork nights."\n\n"It won\'t be enough."\n\n"Then the firm will have to double the force."\n\n"Where are you going to get the men?"\n\n"Advertise for them—hunt for them—take them from other shipyards if\nnecessary. If Uncle Sam wants those ships he is going to have them. But\na war against the world! It\'s enough to stagger a fellow, Andy."\n\n"So it is, Oscar, but it was bound to come, ',
    'sooner or later. Foreign\nnations have been watching the United States with great envy since we\nwhipped the Spaniards and gathered in Porto Rico and the Philippines,\nand when Cuba became a new state and Canada broke loose from England, I\nreckon they thought we were getting too big for our boots."\n\n"No, the real trouble started in China," was the answer from Oscar\nPelham. "England, France, Germany, Russia and Japan wanted to carve up\npoor China to suit themselves during the Yellow War of 1925 and Uncle\nSam wouldn\'t allow it. Then South Africa tried for liberty again, and\nthat put England\'s nose out of joint worse than ever when we helped the\nBoers to freedom. Then came the old quarrel about that money Turkey is\nowing us, and when we turned the Turkish kingdom inside out in 1928 that\nset all the rest of Europe in a rage."\n\n"Well, we were justified in going for the Turks. They are the worst\nheathens on the face of the globe, outside of the Chinese."\n\n"The Chinese ought to be our friends in this war, for we did so much for\nthem when the other nations were after them. But England, Russia and the\nJapanese have bought her, body and soul, and now she is against us with\nall the rest."\n\n"But we\'ll win out—we must win out!"\n\n"Right you are! The Stars and Stripes forever!"\n\nThe conversation recorded above took place one spring morning of the\nyear 1936.\n\nFor two years the United States—that vast territory which now embraces\nall of North America, from the Isthmus of Panama to Hudson Bay, and\ntakes in all of the West Indies, Hawaii, the Philippines, and half a\ndozen other islands of the sea, as well as a corner of China and another\ncorner of Japan—had been at peace with the world. We say peace. What we\nmean is, there was no war, but war talk was on every tongue.\n\nIn the past twenty-five years the country had prospered immensely. We\nnow numbered over a hundred million of inhabitants, and nearly all of\nthese were well-to-do and had money in the bank.\n\nJefferson McKinley Adams was ',
    'President, and had been for six years, and\nunder him were a standing army of five hundred thousand men, and a navy\nof five hundred of the best warships which human ingenuity could devise.\n\nMany of the best of the warships had been turned out at the Standard\nShip Yard at Bridgeport, which, up to a year before, had been under the\npersonal supervision of Commodore David Pelham, the father of Oscar\nPelham, just introduced. David Pelham had been a retired veteran of the\nCivil and the Spanish-American wars, and had followed his beloved wife\nto her grave, leaving Oscar alone in the world.\n\nOscar Pelham was a young man of nearly twenty, well-built and strong,\nwith piercing black eyes and curly black hair.\n\nAt first he thought to follow his father into the navy, but he had a\nstrong taste for electricity and mechanics generally, and he ended by\nentering the services of the ship building company, after spending three\nyears at Edison\'s Electrical University at Llewellyn Park.\n\nOscar was a smart young man, and already many of his electric and other\ndevices were beginning to attract attention. When the improved submarine\ntorpedo-boat destroyer, Holland X., was building at Elizabethport he had\ngone to see her, and had come away much impressed by the novel\nconstruction of the craft.\n\n"I\'ll build such a boat myself some day," he said to his boy friends,\n"only I\'ll make her better than anything afloat."\n\nSome of his friends laughed at this, but others only smiled faintly.\n"Perhaps the boy is right," said one old machinist. "He had a smart\nfather and a smart grandfather. Blood ought to tell."\n\nAnd blood did tell, for, although only twenty years old, Oscar now had\nthe whole run of the extensive shipyard and hardly any plan went through\nbut what somebody came to him for his opinion on it.\n\nOnce Oscar disapproved of the plan of a new submarine boat, invented by\nan old war captain from Vermont.\n\n"That boat will sink fast enough," he said. "But she won\'t come up."\n\nThe experts laughed at him ',
    'and said he was mistaken. Then the boat was\nbuilt. She sank on her first trial and blew up in her effort to raise\nherself.\n\nAfter that Oscar Pelham\'s opinion counted for a good deal in all matters\nunder consideration, so far as ship structure and the use of electricity\nwent.\n\n"Can\'t git around him," said George Dross, the oldest engineer in the\nyard. "He\'s got it all down on his finger tips. Him as tries ter corner\nhim will git bit sure!"\n\nThe visit to the Holland X. had never left Oscar\'s mind. He remembered\nexactly how the submarine destroyer had been built and just how she was\nworked.\n\nOnce, when some of the naval vessels were at Newport, the Holland X.\ntook a midnight trip among them, and Oscar was allowed on board.\n\nThe destroyer sank almost out of sight, and unknown to those on the big\nwarships, passed completely around and under, first one vessel and then\nanother.\n\n"We could have blown every warship sky high!" said the inventor, but of\nthis Oscar was doubtful. Yet he realized that the Holland X. was a grand\nboat and one calculated to do some terrific damage in a naval contest.\n\n"But I\'ll build a better—wait and see," he said, over and over again,\nand when he was nineteen years of age he began to perfect the plans\nwhich had rested so long in his brain.\n\nHis boat was to be built of aluminum and steel—aluminum on account of\nits lightness and steel because of its strength. The craft was to be one\nhundred and fifteen feet long, sixteen feet wide, and eight to eleven\nfeet six inches high. She was to be shaped like a stubby cigar and have\nthree windows of glass on each side and one in front, and another in the\nstern. She was to have two small but exceedingly powerful screws,\noperated by an electric engine. She was to carry both natural and\nmanufactured air, and had ample space for provisions and water, as well\nas ammunition, the latter to consist principally of torpedo tubes and\ndynamite bombs. She was to attain, under favorable circumstances, a\nspeed of twenty-three ',
    'knots an hour, and must work absolutely without\nnoise, both while under water and while sailing over the surface.\n\nLuckily for Oscar Pelham, his father had been rich, and upon the\ncommodore\'s death, all the wealth went to the young inventor, to do with\nexactly as the young man saw fit. Several thousands of dollars were\nimmediately spent upon a model of the Holland XI., as Oscar christened\nhis craft, and this model was, one dark night, taken out on Long Island\nSound for a trial.\n\nNo one was in the secret but Oscar and his particular friend, Andy\nGreggs, and it must be confessed that Andy was almost as anxious for\nsuccess as the young inventor himself.\n\n"If she runs all right, she\'ll be the biggest thing on the water," he\ndeclared.\n\n"You ought to say, under the water," said Oscar.\n\nThe trial took the best part of the night and when it proved a perfect\nsuccess Oscar Pelham could hardly contain himself.\n\n"She\'ll be the submarine terror," he observed. "No warship, no matter\nhow big she is, will be able to stand up against her secret attacks."\n\nCHAPTER II.\n\nFIRST BATTLE ON THE OCEAN.\n\nThe news that war had been declared against practically the whole\ncivilized world was correct.\n\nIn a thousand ways Uncle Sam tried to settle the many existing troubles\nwithout an appeal to arms, and had failed in each and every instance.\n\nOther nations looked with keen envy upon our growth and development.\n\n"We must cut that nation down," they said. "If we do not it will, sooner\nor later, rule us all, commercially and otherwise."\n\nYet the United States had no intention of ruling any nation without the\npeople\'s consent.\n\nFreedom had been given to Cuba and the Philippines, and some years later\nthese islands had begged to be admitted, first as territories and then\nas states.\n\nThey saw how much it would be to their advantage to form part of our\nglorious Union. They saw that the United States was destined to become\nthe one great world power.\n\nEven when this great war broke out—the like of which ',
    'the world had never\nbefore witnessed—several large countries of South America, as well as\nseveral smaller countries of Central America, were knocking for\nadmission into the Union. Brazil, Chili, Peru and Honduras were among\nthose who wished to enter.\n\nMexico had come in through the solicitation of the people of Texas, and\nafter her admission the bitter Mexican war of 1848 was forgotten.\n\nAnd nothing was now heard of the contest against the Filipinos.\nAguinaldo was dead, yet in the main square of Manila an imposing\nmonument had been erected to this remarkable military personage who had\ndone so much and yet so little for his countrymen.\n\nThe appeal to arms created a tremendous excitement, both in the cities\nand in the country places.\n\nIn New York the whole population went wild, and a grand "war march," as\nit was termed, took place. The city at that time was built up solid as\nfar as Yonkers, and the marchers proceeded as far as that, while some of\nthe columns went over the four bridges uniting New York and Brooklyn and\nthe two bridges reaching from Manhattan Island to the New Jersey shore.\n\nThe decorations were magnificent, and Oscar Pelham and Andy Greggs came\ndown from Bridgeport to see them. Banners were flung from the tops of\nall the big buildings, including the Empire, which was fifty-six stories\nhigh, and balloons were anchored a mile in the air, each ablaze with\nelectric lights, turning night into day.\n\nIt was felt that the war would be carried on principally on the ocean,\nor rather, on the oceans, and for that purpose every available warship\nwas put into service with all possible speed.\n\nEnlistments in the navy were followed by enlistments in the army, until\nour soldiers and sailors numbered over a million men.\n\nThe soldiers were armed with the Miles-Gilford electric repeating\nrifles, which were known to shoot with great accuracy up to two thousand\nyards.\n\nThe rifles of the sharpshooters were fitted with telescopes, and many of\nthe sharpshooters could pick off ',
    'an enemy at a mile distance with ease.\n\nIt was felt that the combined navies of the world would come first to\nour Eastern seacoast, and the coast defenses were put in the best\npossible condition without delay.\n\nThe forts at Sandy Hook and on Long Island were armed with the latest\nimproved Hotchkiss bomb guns, which could carry projectiles weighing a\nthousand pounds a distance of sixteen to eighteen miles.\n\nBut it was felt that these fortifications were not sufficient, and\nothers were speedily projected, taking in the whole coast from Nova\nScotia to Florida, as well as Cuba, Porto Rico and other islands in that\nvicinity.\n\nOur naval vessels, as said before, were as good as any on the face of\nthe globe, and included the submarine boat, Holland, the one first\naccepted by the government in 1900, and also the Hollands III., V., VI.,\nIX. and X., the II., IV., VII. and VIII. having been destroyed or\ncondemned.\n\nMuch was expected of the Holland boats, especially in night work, when\nthey might run out to any foreign warship and wreck her with one or more\npowerful torpedoes attached to her hull.\n\nThose who managed the submarine vessels were enthusiastic about them,\nand had good reason to be.\n\nOne day Andy Greggs came into the shipyard wild with excitement.\n\n"Something awful has happened!" he cried, as soon as he met Oscar.\n\n"What is it?" demanded the young inventor.\n\n"The Holland I. has been blown up into a million pieces!"\n\n"Andy, you can\'t mean it."\n\n"It\'s true."\n\n"Who did it, some of the foreign warships?"\n\n"No, one mean, miserable skunk of a man did it all."\n\n"And who was he?"\n\n"An Italian named Gabretti. He was employed on the boat as an engineer.\nThe foreign governments bought him up, it\'s said, for a hundred thousand\ndollars, and he blew her up by connecting an electric battery with the\ntorpedoes she was carrying."\n\n"And were the crew killed?"\n\n"To a man. Gabretti had just time enough to get into a steam launch when\nthe Holland sailed skyward. The steam launch was ',
    'followed by the cruiser\nMassachusetts, but escaped in the darkness, and it is surmised that the\nItalian went on board one of the foreign warships cruising around the\nAtlantic Ocean."\n\nThis news, startling as it was, was true.\n\nBitter was the denunciation of the Italian engineer, who was a\nnaturalized citizen, and who had thus proved a traitor to his country,\nand the government immediately offered a reward of fifty thousand\ndollars for his capture, dead or alive.\n\n"I\'d like to earn that reward," said Andy Greggs.\n\n"I would like to capture him," returned Oscar Pelham. "The traitor! He\nought to be tortured to death!" Oscar came from a long line of true-blue\npatriots, and to his mind a traitor was the worst thing to be imagined.\n\nThe loss of the Holland I was a sore one for the United States, for\nduring the past year England, Germany and France had constructed\nsubmarine boats of more or less efficacy, and it was now felt that we\nwere at a disadvantage so far as this class of vessel was concerned.\n\nBut worse news followed. In two days came word that all the other\nsubmarine craft were either blown up or seriously damaged.\n\nSoon came the news that a great fleet of foreign warships had been\nsighted off the coast of Nova Scotia. The guns at the forts in this\nvicinity had tried to reach the flotilla, but failed, for the foreign\nvessels had kept well out to sea.\n\nThe foreigners were headed southward, and it was felt that they would\nprobably attack Boston or New York.\n\nThe foreign vessels numbered at least fifteen and to combat them the\nUnited States sent out twelve of their best warships, including the new\nColumbia, an armored cruiser of eighteen thousand tons displacement and\ncarrying a battery of twelve twenty-pounders and sixteen twenty-inch\nguns.\n\nThe foreign fleet was sighted off Montauk Point and it was seen to head\ndirectly for New York Harbor.\n\nIt was on a rainy Saturday that the two fleets met, twenty miles off\nSandy Hook.\n\nThe foreign ships had tried to enter New York ',
    'Harbor under cover of the\ndarkness the night before, but the powerful searchlights at Sandy Hook\nhad exposed them, and one ship had been sunk by the guns from the forts\nand another had struck a submerged mine and been literally split in\ntwain.\n\nIt was thirteen vessels to twelve, and the fight opened with a terrific\nbombardment from both sides which lasted for nearly an hour. The din\ncould be plainly heard in New York, where it sounded like rolling\nthunder, and the top of every tall building was covered with spectators,\nwith first-class telescopes, watching the magnificent contest.\n\nAt the end of an hour it looked as if the Americans had the better of\nthe fight and those on shore were jubilant in consequence.\n\n"We\'ll lick \'em out of their boots!" shouted more than one old veteran.\n"It\'s America against the world, and we are bound to come out on top!"\n\nAt this time but one American vessel, the Chicago, had sunk. Of the\nforeigners, a German and a French vessel were blown up, while a large\nRussian man-of-war and an Italian cruiser were in flames from stem to\nstern.\n\nBut now the fortunes of war turned swiftly.\n\nFor some unknown reason, the French and the German submarine boats which\nhad accompanied the expedition had been delayed in getting to the battle\nground, having run foul of some wreckage off the coast of Long Island.\n\nNow they came up, and after some minute directions from the admiral in\ncommand of the Allies, as the foreigners were termed, both boats sank\npromptly out of sight.\n\nIt was afterward learned that the French submarine vessel could do next\nto nothing. She tried to sink the Indiana, but was promptly discovered\nand two fifteen-inch shells soon put her out of existence forever.\n\nNot so, however, with the German craft, a boat fully the equal of any of\nthe ill-fated Hollands. She came up silently under three of the American\nwarships, and half an hour later every one of those gallant cruisers was\nwrecked and hundreds of those on board were killed.\n\nThe shock was ',
    'so unexpected that the Americans for the moment knew not\nwhat to do. Then another ship was blown up, and the few which remained\nhad to withdraw to New York Harbor, where they were under the protection\nof the guns of the numerous forts.\n\nCHAPTER III.\n\nAN INTERVIEW WITH THE SECRETARY OF THE NAVY.\n\n"Andy, I am going to see the Secretary of the Navy, and at once."\n\n"About your submarine boat, Oscar?"\n\n"Yes."\n\n"I thought you had written to him about it."\n\n"So I have, but the Old Harry knows what has become of the letter."\n\n"More than likely they thought your scheme that of a wild-brained\ninventor and cast the letter aside."\n\n"So I\'ve been thinking. I start for Washington to-morrow."\n\n"Want me to go along?"\n\n"No, I want you to remain here and take charge of that model, which is\nin the storeroom at my boarding-house. If I telegraph to you, you come\non with the model, at once."\n\nSo it was agreed, and that night saw Oscar Pelham whirling toward the\ncapital at the rate of eighty-five miles an hour, on what was known as\nthe Congressional Limited.\n\nThis train was a great favorite with politicians and on the cars Oscar\nmet many men who had known his father.\n\nOne in particular, Senator Forbish, from New York, became interested in\nthe young inventor, and asked him why he was making the trip.\n\n"Going to try for a position in the navy, to follow in the footsteps of\nyour father?" he questioned.\n\n"Yes and no," answered Oscar. "I will enter the navy if they will allow\nme to do so in my own way."\n\n"Then you are particular. Perhaps you wish the command of a ship." And\nthe senator smiled pleasantly.\n\n"I do wish the command of a ship—but the ship must be of my own\ndesigning."\n\nSenator Forbish could readily see that Oscar was not joking, and he\nasked the young man to explain himself, which Oscar did readily, for he\nknew the senator was a power, both in military and in naval circles.\n\n"And you say this boat will really work?" he questioned.\n\n"Yes. The model worked perfectly when we tried ',
    'her in Long Island\nSound."\n\n"Such a submarine boat would be far in advance of the others which we\nhave lost."\n\n"She would be, and that would mean that she would also be superior to\nthe submarine boats owned by our foreign foes."\n\n"Then you must press this matter upon Secretary Short by all means."\n\n"I shall do my best. But he may not be willing to listen to me. I\nunderstand he is very busy."\n\n"He is busy, but I will give you a letter to him which will insure you\nan audience."\n\nThe senator was as good as his word. There was a stenographer and\ntypewriter on the train and he dictated a letter and signed it without\ndelay.\n\nWhen Oscar reached Washington he found the entire city in a state of\nsuppressed excitement. The destruction of the American warships off New\nYork Harbor was on everybody\'s lips, and many predicted that the United\nStates would soon be at the mercy of her foreign foes.\n\n"And they will show us no mercy," they declared. "They are too anxious\nto see us broken to pieces. England will retake Canada, Mexico will go\nto Spain, Russia will cry for Alaska, with its gold, while France and\nGermany will want a slice of the Eastern coast and China and Japan a\nslice of the Western."\n\nWhen Oscar arrived at the office of the Secretary of the Navy he found\nthe cabinet officials busy in the extreme. Naval officers, politicians\nand citizens looking after contracts filled the rooms and corridors, and\nclerks and messengers were coming and going constantly.\n\n"What is it you want?" demanded a clerk, as he met the young inventor at\nthe inquiry desk.\n\n"I wish to see Secretary Short," was the answer.\n\n"On what business?"\n\n"That is a private matter."\n\n"The secretary is very busy to-day; better call to-morrow."\n\n"I think he will see me." And Oscar handed out his card.\n\n"Hum! Does he know you?"\n\n"No."\n\n"Then I think you are mistaken. Nearly all strangers must first go and\nsee one or the other of his assistants."\n\n"Here is a letter of introduction from Senator Forbish," ',
    'continued\nOscar, with a quiet smile.\n\nThe face of the clerk immediately changed color.\n\n"Oh—er—of course that makes a difference, Mr. Pelham. I will take your\ncard and the letter to the secretary at once."\n\nThe clerk dove through a swinging door and was gone the best part of ten\nminutes.\n\n"Secretary Short will see you at half-past three," he announced. "Be on\ntime if you want to make sure of your interview, and boil your business\ndown."\n\n"I\'ll be on time, never fear."\n\nPromptly at half-past three Oscar was admitted to the private office of\nthe Secretary of the United States navy.\n\nIt was a large apartment, handsomely fitted up, and on the walls hung\nnumerous charts of our coast defenses and pictures of war vessels. In\none corner rested several models of ships, including one of the\nill-fated Holland X.\n\n"Well, young man, what can I do for you?" asked the secretary, as he\nmotioned the young inventor to a chair.\n\n"Secretary Short, you can give me the opportunity to destroy some of the\nforeign warships which are battling against us," answered Oscar.\n\n"Eh? Er—what\'s that?" said the secretary, who feared he had not heard\naright.\n\n"To be brief, sir, I am the son of the late Commodore David Pelham, whom\nyou, I think, knew fairly well. I am a practical electrician and\ninventor. I have worked around shipyards for a number of years. I have\ninvented a submarine torpedo-boat, somewhat on the lines of the late\nHolland, but with numerous changes, which I know will be beneficial. I\nwant to build this ship for the government and I want to be placed in\ncommand of her when she is built."\n\nThe Secretary of the Navy stared at Oscar in amazement. "What, you! Why,\nreally you are—a very young man to talk in this fashion."\n\n"That is true, sir. But if I prove that I have a boat superior to any of\nthe Hollands, will you take me up?"\n\n"Certainly; we want the best ships, submarine and otherwise, that money\ncan buy. Expense is no object. But I have no time to waste now on\nexperiments. The war is on; we have ',
    'already suffered a tremendous loss,\nas you must know."\n\n"I have a working model. At this time to-morrow, if you\'ll say the word,\nI\'ll have that model at the government experimental station and I will\nshow you how perfectly it works."\n\n"You are positive you have a good thing?" And the secretary looked\nsharply at the young inventor, as if to read his innermost thoughts.\n\n"I am, sir."\n\n"Then I will be at the station to see your model work, at five o\'clock,\nto-morrow."\n\nCHAPTER IV.\n\nBLOWING UP OF THE TIEN-TSIN.\n\nThe Secretary of the Navy was as good as his word. He was on hand five\nminutes before five, and Oscar arrived ten minutes earlier, accompanied\nby Andy Greggs, who had had the model shipped on by express, in a stout\ncoffin-like box.\n\nThe government experiment station boasted of a large pond of water,\nwhere all sorts of models were tried and experiments made.\n\nIn the presence of the secretary and two of his assistants the model was\nproduced.\n\nAt this moment the President of the United States, Jefferson McKinley\nAdams, a descendant of John Adams, the second President, came in to see\nwhat was going on, having heard that something unusual was in the air.\n\n"We need such a boat, if it will work, now the Hollands are no more," he\nmurmured to the Secretary of the Navy.\n\n"Wait—we will see if this is all right or a humbug," answered Secretary\nShort.\n\nThe model was placed on a stand and Oscar gave a little lecture\nconcerning the working parts and what the craft was designed to do.\n\nThe model went to the bottom of the basin and arose without an effort.\nThen it went down as far as desired, ran forward, backward, and then\nturned in circles right and left. The screws were next shifted slightly\nand the model went forward in saw-tooth fashion, first up and then down,\nbut all under water.\n\n"Wonderful!" murmured the President. "The old Hollands could not do\nthat."\n\n"He has certainly solved the science of under-water navigation,"\nanswered the Secretary of the Navy.\n\nA model of a ',
    'warship was now placed in the basin, at one end. Then the\nmodel of the submarine craft was set in motion to place a torpedo under\nthe warship\'s keel. The work was performed with great accuracy and it\nwas shown how easily the warship could be destroyed and how quickly the\nother boat could get away without being discovered.\n\n"Good! It is perfect!" cried the Secretary of the Navy. "But how about\nair for your crew while under water?"\n\nOscar then went into the details of his scheme for storing air and for\nmanufacturing it as well. Everybody listened with close attention.\n\n"How much will your craft cost to build?" was the next question asked.\n\n"Two hundred thousand dollars," was the answer. "For into that\nconstruction must go the best of everything."\n\nThose who had witnessed the exhibition consulted together for a few\nminutes.\n\n"How long will she take to build?"\n\n"Give me that sum and I will build her in three months; give me a\nhundred thousand dollars more and I will have her ready for service in\ntwo months."\n\n"You shall have your answer to-morrow noon," said the Secretary of the\nNavy.\n\nThe night to follow was an anxious one, both for Oscar Pelham and his\nfaithful friend, Andy Greggs.\n\nWould the government accept the offer?\n\nAt ten the next morning came a telephone message from the Navy\nDepartment.\n\n"We are willing to appropriate half a million dollars if that submarine\nboat, to be called the new Holland, can be built inside of one month."\n\nEven Oscar was staggered at this.\n\n"A month!" he gasped. "But I\'ll do it if I have to set every shipyard\nand every steel plant at work to push it through."\n\nFor thirty days Oscar Pelham hardly ate, drank or slept.\n\nHe was here, there and everywhere, now inspecting this work done, now\nthat work done, and anon sending telegrams and telephone messages in\nevery direction.\n\nSome refused to do any work for him, thinking him mad. But when his\norders were indorsed by the Navy Department, owners of shipyards and\nsteel plants quickly changed their ',
    'minds.\n\nWork went on night and day, without interruption, and on the afternoon\nof the twenty-ninth day the new Holland was slid into the waters of New\nYork bay and a telegram was sent to Secretary Short that the vessel was\nready for service.\n\nIn the meantime the war had gone on and another naval battle had been\nfought in Cuban waters. Here an Italian cruiser had been sunk by the\ngunboat Yankee Doodle, but the Americans had lost four of their\nold-fashioned types of war vessel.\n\nIt was reported that a flotilla of sixteen foreign warships was in the\nvicinity of Cuba, and that soon there would be an active bombardment of\nthe whole Cuban coast.\n\n"If they capture Cuba they will use the island as a base of supplies,"\nsaid the Secretary of the Navy, "and they will be able to land millions\nof soldiers there. We must stop this movement."\n\nTen first-class warships had been dispatched to the seat of trouble, and\nnow the new Holland was ordered thither, after a trial off the New\nJersey coast to see that the new vessel worked perfectly.\n\nThe crew of the new Holland, or Holland XI., as she was officially\nregistered, consisted of ten all told. Oscar was placed in supreme\ncommand, with a rank in the navy as captain. Next to him came Andy\nGreggs, as first lieutenant. The head engineer was George Dross, the old\nshipbuilder, who had stood by Oscar when he was building his model at\nBridgeport.\n\nThe Holland was stored with provisions and fresh air and a number of\npowerful torpedoes, along with a large amount of other explosives.\n\n"Good-bye to land," said Oscar, as he stepped on board. "We are running\na great risk, Andy. Perhaps we will never see home again."\n\n"I don\'t care. Hurrah for Uncle Sam!" responded the first lieutenant,\nrecklessly.\n\nSoon the Holland—we shall at all times call her by her simple name—was\nmoving southward at a lively rate of speed.\n\nAs there was no need to draw on the air in the reservoirs the boat was\nkept on the surface of the ocean, skimming along like some ',
    'monster\nsea-fowl.\n\nFour days later Captain Oscar Pelham was able to report to Commodore\nGarrison, in command of the fleet in Cuban waters.\n\nAnother great naval battle was expected daily and Commodore Garrison was\nglad to see the Holland put in an appearance.\n\n"I have heard that there is one monster Chinese armored cruiser coming\nup here from the coast of Brazil," said the commodore. "She is one of\nthe swiftest and most dangerous craft in the world. She is named the\nTien-Tsin. If you can blow her up it will be a great work accomplished."\n\n"We shall do our best," replied Captain Oscar promptly.\n\nHe passed the word around and the Holland ran along the Eastern coast of\nCuba, on the lookout for the Tien-Tsin.\n\nSoon several warships were sighted and two days later the Tien-Tsin hove\nin sight and began to bombard the Cuban city of Baracoa.\n\nIt was the intention of the Chinese commander to make the city surrender\nand then land an army of three thousand Celestials in Cuba, as the\nbeginning of a great command of invasion.\n\n"The Tien-Tsin is in sight," cried Andy, who was the first to sight the\ncraft.\n\nCaptain Oscar waited long enough to confirm the news, then gave orders\nthat the Holland XI. be sunk immediately.\n\nDown went the torpedo-boat destroyer until fully twenty-five feet of\nwater floated over her.\n\nThe Chinese cruiser had stopped her powerful engines and lay motionless\non the ocean, while she poured shot and shell into the city, four miles\naway, to the terror of the Cubans, who were fleeing in all directions.\n\nSwiftly but silently the new Holland crept up until almost under the\nkeel of the Celestials\' warship.\n\nThen a large torpedo was sent forth and fastened to the warship\'s broad\nbottom.\n\nTo the torpedo was attached a clock-like arrangement, and this was set\nat the five-minute limit.\n\n"Now, away!" cried Captain Oscar, when the work was done. "Dross, crowd\non all speed!"\n\nAnd, like a thing of life, the Holland darted off in the direction where\nthe American fleet lay, miles ',
    'off.\n\nOne minute passed—two—three—four—and those on the Holland watched their\nwatches anxiously.\n\n"We will ascend!" cried Captain Oscar, and up shot the boat to the\nsurface.\n\nFour minutes and a half—three-quarters—fifty seconds—fifty-five\nseconds—six—seven—eight—nine——\n\nCrash! Bang! Boom!\n\nIt was as if heaven and earth were split in twain. First there came a\nflash as of lightning out of the depths of the ocean, followed by a\ngrinding, ripping, sucking noise, and then up went the monster Chinese\ncruiser, blown into millions of fragments. With the wreckage went\nsoldiers and sailors, guns, ammunition, spars, everything, straight into\nthe sky! It was a sight as awful as it was amusing.\n\n"She\'s gone forever!" cried Captain Oscar, hoarsely. "Our work has\nproved a perfect success. The new Holland is the most dangerous warship\never constructed."\n\n"You are right," answered his first lieutenant. "Those Chinese——"\n\nHe got no further, for he had glanced up in the sky, and now saw\nsomething strange and uncanny approaching. It was a gigantic dynamite\nshell, thrown by a French cruiser, which had crept up behind them\nunawares.\n\nThe shell was aimed straight for the Holland, and if it struck the\nsubmarine boat it would blow her up as effectively as she had blown up\nthe Tien-Tsin!\n\nCHAPTER V.\n\nPRISONERS OF THE SEA.\n\n"We are lost!"\n\n"That shell will blow us to atoms!"\n\nSuch were some of the cries which arose from those on the new Holland\nwhen they saw the shell thrown by the French cruiser whirling swiftly\ntoward them.\n\nIn an instant all was wild excitement and the face of Andy Greggs grew\npale as death.\n\nBut one person on the submarine craft was cool, and that was Oscar\nPelham.\n\nAs he saw the shell approaching he stepped to the rear end of the tiny\nenclosed deck of which the Holland boasted.\n\nHere was a hidden keyboard, connected by electricity with the moving\npower of the strange craft.\n\nHe touched one of the tiny steel buttons.\n\n"Hold fast!" he cried, and as everybody clutched the ',
    'railing or threw\nhimself flat, the Holland fairly jerked forward, rising two feet higher\nthan she had been lying, by the action of the sudden spurt. Then she\ncontinued to go ahead.\n\nZip! Bang!\n\nDown came the shell from the French cruiser in the exact spot where the\nHolland had been lying. It sent the water flying in all directions,\nwhile the noise of the explosion was deafening.\n\nThe submarine torpedo-boat destroyer had gotten away a distance of a\nhundred yards, and some of the fragments of the shell rained down upon\nthe deck like hail.\n\nThe forward rush had made the Holland ship considerable water, and for\nthe instant it looked as if the submarine craft would be swamped.\n\nThe French cruiser was coming closer, and now another shell was hurled\nforth, but this flew wide of the mark.\n\n"We must go down," said Captain Oscar, and at once those on deck tumbled\ninto the interior of the submarine boat. Then the steel hatch was\nclosed, the railing sank out of sight, and the new Holland sunk beneath\nthe surface of the ocean.\n\nBy examination it was found that the boat contained six inches of water,\nand this was immediately forced out by the electric pump. Then Oscar\nentered the engine room and held a consultation with George Dross.\n\n"Are we safe in descending twenty-five feet in these waters?" he asked.\n\nA chart was examined and it was found that they might descend forty feet\nwithout danger of running aground, providing they kept in the old\nchannel.\n\n"Then put on all speed, descend thirty feet, and bring up behind that\nFrench cruiser," was the young captain\'s order.\n\n"You will sink her?" questioned Andy.\n\n"If we can."\n\n"But the commodore\'s orders——"\n\n"Orders from the Secretary of the Navy are to sink any foreign vessel\nthat opens fire on us. The government has half a million dollars locked\nup in this vessel, and Uncle Sam doesn\'t intend to lose her."\n\nNo more was said, and soon the new Holland was gliding through the ocean\nwith the rapidity and silence of some monstrous sea ',
    "serpent.\n\nWhile she was thus moving Oscar had the crew arrange another torpedo,\nsimilar to that which had blown up the Tien-Tsin.\n\nHe remained at the side window nearest to the front of the submarine\nboat, watching for anything unusual which might occur.\n\nAs they moved on in a large semi-circle a sight met his gaze which was\ntruly horrible.\n\nThey passed through the wreckage of the big Chinese cruiser, and on\nevery side he saw the torn and mutilated bodies of the Chinese sailors\nand soldiers, some dead and some drowning, sinking slowly to the bottom\nof the ocean.\n\nOne poor wretch made a mad clutch at the glass window as it passed him\nand glared fiercely into Oscar's face.\n\nThe sight made Oscar shudder and brought to him a sense of how horrible\nthis fearful war was to be.\n\nBut now was no time to think of these things.\n\nThe French cruiser had noted the disappearance of the submarine boat and\nher commander was doing his best to get out of danger.\n\nHe had crowded on all steam and felt that it would be impossible for any\nsubmarine boat to catch the Republique, as his craft was named.\n\nHe did not know that the new Holland was one of the fastest ships\nafloat—much faster, in fact, than any submarine craft built up to that\ntime.\n\nAlthough it was daylight, he kept a powerful searchlight at work, trying\nin vain to locate the Holland XI. under that rolling cover of\ngreenish-blue waves.\n\nBut here he again failed, for the Holland kept too far below the surface\nto be thus located.\n\nAt last Captain Oscar saw that they were less than fifty yards behind\nthe Republique.\n\nBoth vessels were going at their topmost speed, and thus the pursuit was\na highly dangerous one.\n\nThe new Holland was up on a level with the Frenchman's keel, and should\nthe speed of the cruiser slacken suddenly the submarine craft would\nsurely crash into her with disastrous effect.\n\n\"Get ready to throw out that torpedo,\" ordered the young captain of the\nsubmarine destroyer, and his crew obeyed without delay.\n\nIn a few ",
    'seconds more they were directly under the Frenchman\'s keel, and\nthen the torpedo was brought out, ready to be adjusted.\n\nAt that moment something unlooked for occurred, something which nearly\nbrought the new Holland to an end then and there.\n\nIn her anxiety to get away from the torpedo destroyer those on the\nRepublique had run close to a stretch of land on the Cuban coast which\nhid from view a bay half a mile in diameter.\n\nIn this bay were located three American men-of-war, of the old style,\nbut fitted up with modern dynamite guns.\n\nAs the Republique came in sight of the Yankee warships, all three opened\nfire on her.\n\nThe aim of the American gunners was perfect, and five ten-inch shells\ncrashed through the side of the French cruiser.\n\nThree of the shots went below the water-mark, while a fourth struck into\nthe magazine.\n\nThere was a deafening explosion, which tore away the middle deck of the\ncruiser, and then the huge mass of iron and steel began to sink like one\nvast lump of lead.\n\nShe came down directly on top of the new Holland, at the very moment\nthat the time fuse had been set in motion by which the torpedo was to be\nblown up.\n\n"By ginger! Something\'s wrong!" came from old George Dross. "She\'s\na-comin\' down on top o\' us!"\n\n"Back her!" ordered Captain Oscar. "Back, quick!"\n\nBut it was too late to back. Down came that monstrous weight, settling\ndirectly on top of the new Holland and quickly burying the submarine\ncraft in several feet of sand!\n\nLuckily the French cruiser rested, fore and aft, upon two slight hills,\nforming something of a hollow in the middle, otherwise the Holland XI.\nmust have been totally crushed.\n\nAs the submarine craft was pinned fast, Andy Greggs clutched Oscar by\nthe arm.\n\n"We are lost, Oscar!" he gasped. "That fuse—it is ready to go off!"\n\nThe young captain nodded, for words failed him. The fuse was set for\nthree minutes. Two minutes had already passed. A minute more—and then?\n\nOne of the crew—ordinarily a brave man—fell upon his knees, the ',
    'tears\nstreaming down his cheeks.\n\n"Nothing can save us!" he moaned. "That torpedo will crush us into a\nmillion pieces!"\n\nThirty seconds passed—forty-five. Everybody on board held his breath.\nCaptain Oscar felt as if his head was on the block and the axe of the\nexecutioner ready to fall.\n\nAnd then the full minute passed—swiftly, silently—and then another\nminute. One and another straightened up and each looked at his comrades\nas if doubting that he was not dreaming.\n\nThe torpedo had failed to explode!\n\n"The shock of the wreck must have torn the fuse from its place," said\nCaptain Oscar.\n\n"Pray heaven such is a fact!" murmured his lieutenant.\n\nThe wrecked Republique was still settling, and through one of the\nwindows which was not buried in the sand they saw numerous dark objects\nfloating about, including the bodies of some French sailors.\n\nBut now was no time to look upon such sights.\n\n"We must get out of this," said the young captain. "The longer we remain\nhere the deeper we will be buried in the sand and the harder it will be\nfor us to get away."\n\n"Right you are," answered his lieutenant. "But how shall we move?"\n\nThat was a difficult question to answer just then, for nothing could be\nseen excepting out of one window on the left side and out of one window\nin the rear.\n\n"I think we had better try to back first," said Captain Oscar. "Dross,\nput on all power."\n\n"Aye! aye!" responded the old engineer, and soon the dynamos on board\nwere working as never before. But though the screws revolved with\nlightning-like rapidity, the new Holland scarcely budged. The screws\nwhirled the sand in every direction, sending it against the rear window\nlike, a sheet of hail.\n\n"We don\'t move," said Andy Greggs.\n\n"Try to go ahead," suggested Captain Oscar, "Have we reached the limit\nof our power?"\n\n"We have," answered the old engineer.\n\nAgain the screws were set in motion. The submarine boat strained and\nquivered, as if to pull in twain every bolt that held her together. But\nmove from her ',
    'resting place she did not.\n\nThey were prisoners at the bottom of the ocean.\n\nCHAPTER VI.\n\nOUT OF A LIVING TOMB.\n\nEverybody on board looked to the young captain regarding what move was\nto be attempted next.\n\n"We are stuck," muttered Andy Greggs.\n\n"We must get out," returned Captain Oscar. He turned to one of the men.\n"How much air in the reservoir, Marney?"\n\n"Two hundred and fifteen feet, captain."\n\n"Humph! Enough for two hours."\n\n"And after that?" put in Andy Greggs.\n\nOscar shrugged his shoulders. "We must get out before that time, old\nchum."\n\nAnd this meant that if they did not they would all die of suffocation!\n\nTruly their peril was extreme.\n\nThe weight of the wrecked French cruiser was so great that she was\nslowly but surely sinking deeper and deeper, sending down the Holland\nunder her.\n\nIn another hour the windows would be buried in the sand so that nothing\nof the outer world could be seen.\n\n"We\'ll be in a living tomb," muttered old George Dross.\n\n"If I could get outside I would inspect the situation," said the young\ncaptain.\n\n"If we could get out we might all save ourselves," muttered one of the\nmen.\n\n"And leave the Holland XI.?" returned the inventor. "Never! I\'ll never\ndesert her!" Oscar would no more have thought of leaving his treasure\nthan would a young mother her child.\n\n"The torpedo hole," suggested Andy Greggs.\n\n"Right!" ejaculated Oscar Pelham. "I\'ll do it, if it costs me my life."\n\nWith all speed he donned one of the diver\'s suits with which the\nsubmarine craft was provided.\n\nWhat he intended to do, or rather try to do, was indeed perilous.\n\nThis was nothing more than to leave the Holland through the chamber in\nwhich were stored the torpedoes the craft carried.\n\nHe would have to pass through two trap-doors, and then to the outer sea,\nproviding he could get out.\n\nHis preparations were carefully made and he went out provided with\nseveral instruments by which he might measure the hollow and figure out\nhow best to start the submarine craft.\n\nIt was with great ',
    'difficulty that he squeezed himself out into the\nwater, which here represented a pressure of many pounds to the square\ninch.\n\nThe first thing that his eyes rested upon was the torpedo which had\nfailed to go off.\n\nThe clockwork was still in position, and what had caused it to cease\nmoving was a mystery.\n\n"But it\'s a good thing it didn\'t go off," he mused, as he began his\ninspection of the situation.\n\nHe soon found out why the Holland could not move from her position.\n\nIn coming down the keel of the French cruiser had split into two parts,\nand these now held the top of the Holland fast, as a pair of ice tongs\nholds fast a cake of ice.\n\nHad the ends of the cruiser been allowed to settle a foot more, the two\ngrips of the keel must have crushed in the sides of the Holland like the\nshell of an egg.\n\nOscar examined the ends of the keel with interest and soon felt certain\nthat the Holland could be moved only after great labor to liberate her.\n\n"And that will take time," he muttered sadly. "And time is what we\ncannot afford."\n\nSlowly and painfully he made his way back to the hole through which he\nhad emerged into the ocean.\n\nThe bow of the submarine craft was just gained, when suddenly a\nconcussion occurred which hurled him flat on his back and for some time\nto come deprived him of all sense of hearing.\n\nOne of the powder magazines which had not been touched by water on the\nRepublique had blown up, creating something like an earthquake under the\nsea.\n\nSand and wreckage flew in all directions, and when Captain Oscar\nrecovered he found his body covered with a mass of stuff difficult to\nremove.\n\nAs soon as able he stared about him, and to his utter amazement saw that\nthe Holland had disappeared!\n\n"What can it mean?" he asked himself. "Is it possible she has been blown\nup?"\n\nThe vicinity of the wreck was now dangerous, with so much loose matter\nstill floating about, and as soon as able he left the spot, mounting a\nsand hill several hundred feet away.\n\nThe Holland was nowhere to ',
    'be seen, nor was any wreckage belonging to\nher about. This gave him a little comfort, for he concluded that she\nmust have escaped.\n\nBut he must now pay attention to his own safety, for his supply of fresh\nair was limited, and with the weight of the diver\'s outfit it was\nimpossible to ascend to the surface of the ocean.\n\nWhat should he do?\n\nHe knew the coast of Cuba was near, but in what direction?\n\n"I must move," he told himself. "Anything is better than staying here."\n\nHe moved on, slowly and painfully, to where he thought the bottom of the\nocean ascended gradually. Soon it grew lighter, telling him that he was\ngetting closer to the surface.\n\nBut now the fresh air was almost gone and a sleepy sensation stole over\nhim. But he must not sleep, or it would be the slumber of death!\n\nOn and on he went, now climbing a rugged hill, covered with sand, rocks\nand moss, the home of innumerable fish and strange looking crabs.\n\nThe fish rushed past him, hitting him often with their tails, while the\ncrabs spit at them spitefully, their beady eyes bulging from their\nheads.\n\nHe was almost to the top now, but his air was gone, and with it his\nstrength. There was a strange flicker before his eyes and a roaring in\nhis head.\n\nOnce he stumbled headlong, but quickly picked himself up again.\n\nHalf a dozen steps more and his head came out of the water. Then he\ndragged himself to a higher point and with nervous hands unscrewed his\nair-and-water-tight helmet.\n\nOh, how good the fresh air tasted! It was fairly intoxicating, and he\nfilled his lungs repeatedly.\n\nHe was saved!\n\nLooking around, he found a small jut of land not a dozen yards distant,\nfringed with a series of overhanging bushes and trees.\n\nIt was on the Cuban coast, two miles west of the city which the\nTien-Tsin had been bombarding.\n\nHe dragged himself to the shore, and finding a safe place in the bushes,\nthrew himself down to rest.\n\nFrom a distance he heard the booming of cannon, telling that the Cuban\ncity was being bombarded ',
    'still by other vessels of the foreign foe.\n\nBut to this booming he gave no attention, for he was dead tired.\n\nSoon he dropped into a doze in spite of himself, from which he did not\nawaken until early the next morning.\n\nHe awoke with a start, and then a noise in the bushes beside him caused\nhim to leap to his feet.\n\nHe gave a cry of dismay, for, looking inland, he beheld at least a\nthousand Japanese troops marching in his direction!\n\nThe advance guard was on him and in a moment more he was discovered and\nsurrounded!\n\nCHAPTER VII.\n\nAN ATTACK ON THE JAPANESE TROOPS.\n\n"Chan-cera-ree!" shouted one of the Japanese soldiers, and aimed his\nrifle at Oscar Pelham\'s head.\n\nBut another soldier—an under officer—saw the movement and stopped the\nshooting.\n\n"We will make him a prisoner," he said in Japanese. "He is an American\nand may prove useful to us in this accursed country."\n\nOscar was quickly made to leave the shore.\n\nHe had discarded the diver\'s suit, but the Japanese soldiers took it\nalong, considering it a great curiosity.\n\nBecause of the suit they thought Oscar was one who had planted a mine\nunder the ocean and that the Tien-Tsin had struck upon this and been\nblown up.\n\n"He is a great capture," said the Japanese commander. "Who knows but\nwhat he may be a leading American officer."\n\nAs he could not speak English, he could not question the young inventor.\n\nBaracoa had fallen and Japanese and Chinese troops had landed to the\nnumber of six thousand.\n\nThey expected to be re-enforced by German and French soldiers, and then\na land attack was to be made in Florida, the troops marching across Cuba\nto Havana, and there taking transports to Key West.\n\nIn the meantime England and some other nations were sending a large\nforce, upward of a hundred thousand men—to attack the Canadian shore.\nEngland wished to reconquer Canada, no matter what the cost.\n\nThe Japanese continued to move along the northern coast of Cuba until\ntwo o\'clock in the afternoon.\n\nBy that time it was so hot that the ',
    'soldiers had to rest, even though\nthe Japanese are the toughest race on the face of the globe.\n\nThousands of Cubans had fled before them, for the landing had been\nunexpected, and the people of the island were not prepared to offer\nresistance.\n\nWhen the rest came Oscar found himself at the mouth of a small river\nflowing into the Atlantic Ocean.\n\nHe was secured to a tree with ropes while his captors proceeded to take\nit easy, lying in the grass, smoking cigarettes and drinking Japan tea.\n\nThe young inventor felt that he was in a serious situation, for he knew\nthat in this world-wide war the Japanese would not hesitate to kill him\nwhenever it pleased them.\n\nHe tugged at his bonds, but if there is anybody who knows how to tie\nknots it is a Japanese, and those which bound Oscar could neither be\nstrained or broken.\n\nAn hour went by, when suddenly the young inventor saw something which\nboth amazed and delighted him.\n\nFar off in the ocean he beheld something come up to the surface. It was\nlike the back of a turtle, about four feet in diameter.\n\nIt was only a few inches above the waves, but it shone like a plate of\nbluish steel—and such it was—the top-center plate of the Holland XI!\n\n"Thank fortune, she escaped!" he muttered to himself.\n\nThen he waited for several minutes, when the trap-door in the plate was\nslid aside and a form appeared—head and shoulders—the form of Andy\nGreggs.\n\nAndy had a spy-glass, and with this he swept first the ocean and then\nthe land.\n\nOn catching sight of the Japanese soldiers he was about to retire at\nonce and sink the submarine craft, when by accident his eyes rested upon\nOscar.\n\nAt first he could not believe the evidence of his senses. Then he waved\nhis hand in recognition.\n\nThe young captain of the new Holland could not see the movement very\nwell, but he nodded his head vigorously in the direction of the first\nlieutenant.\n\nIn another moment Andy disappeared and soon the Holland sank from sight.\nOscar waited anxiously, wondering what his friends ',
    'would do—in fact,\nwhat they could do.\n\nThe submarine craft was designed wholly for warfare on and under the\nocean, not on land.\n\nYet Oscar knew that his friends would never desert him, now they knew he\nwas a prisoner of the enemy.\n\nQuarter of an hour went by. To the prisoner it seemed an age.\n\nHe was watching the water and soon saw a slight movement behind a number\nof bushes just where the river met the ocean.\n\nHe knew what the movement meant. The Holland XI. had come in shore as\nfar as the depth of the water permitted.\n\nUp came that plate again and out popped Andy Greggs, armed with a pistol\nand a short knife.\n\nThe young lieutenant slipped into the water like an eel and dove down\nalmost out of sight, to come up near to Oscar\'s feet.\n\nThe Japanese were half asleep, thinking their prisoner secure.\n\nWith cat-like steps Andy left the water, pushed through the bushes and\ncame up behind Oscar.\n\nTwo slashes of that sharp knife and the young captain of the new Holland\nwas free.\n\nHe slid behind the tree, and side by side he and Andy ran for the ocean.\n\n"Hi-cha-kling!" roared one of the Japanese soldiers, rousing suddenly,\nand then he aimed his rifle at Oscar.\n\nBut before he could pull the trigger Andy fired his pistol, which had\nbeen kept dry on the journey to shore, and the bullet pierced the\nenemy\'s heart.\n\nBefore the other Japanese could do anything both of the chums were\nswimming for the Holland. They tumbled into the trap-door one after the\nother and then the plate was slid shut.\n\n"Down!" ordered Andy, and immediately the submarine craft sunk several\nfeet. Then a swift run was made for a third of a mile away from the\ncoast.\n\n"Oh, how glad I am to see you alive!" cried Andy, when the pair were\nsafe.\n\n"And I am glad, too, cap\'n," put in George Dross. "I never expected to\nset eyes on ye ag\'in."\n\n"But how did the Holland escape?" asked the young captain.\n\n"The explosion set us free," answered Andy. "But we had to move out\nlively, or we would have been crushed as flat as a ',
    'pancake when the\nwreckage came down a second time."\n\nCaptain Oscar was now asked to tell his own story and did so. He was\nvery weak, but a good dinner with a strong cup of coffee soon made him\nfeel once more like himself.\n\n"What\'s orders?" asked Andy, coming in the dining-room while he was\neating.\n\n"We must attack that Japanese army," answered the young captain. "They\nare marching for Havana, with the intention of invading Florida."\n\n"And how are you going to do it?"\n\n"They are marching forward in almost a solid body. As soon as they form,\nwe will rise to the surface and throw a couple of dynamite bombs into\ntheir midst."\n\nOrders were at once delivered to the ammunition men and the bombs were\nbrought forth and inspected, to see that they were ready for use.\n\nHalf an hour went by and then they saw that the Japanese were preparing\nto move.\n\nThe enemy did not like the manner in which Oscar had been rescued and\nthe leader wanted to get out of the way of the submarine craft.\n\nSoon the foreign soldiers were in columns for the march and the command\ncame to move forward.\n\nThe drums beat and the band began to play one of the Japanese national\nairs in a music which to the Americans was nothing short of a hideous\ndiscord.\n\n"Now then, up we go," commanded Captain Oscar, and in a minute the new\nHolland lay well out of the water.\n\nThen the stern was sunk, so that the bow might stand well up.\n\nThe gun to fire the two bombs was carefully sighted.\n\n"Touch off!" was the next command.\n\nBoom! went the gun, and into the air flared the two missiles of death,\nstraight for the Japanese column.\n\nZim! crash! bang!\n\nThe two bombs exploded directly in the midst of the Japanese troops,\ndealing death and destruction upon every hand.\n\nThe carnage was something frightful. Dozens of men were literally blown\nto atoms, arms, legs, heads and bodies flying in all directions!\n\nA yell of terror went up, commingled with shrieks of pain.\n\nWhen the smoke cleared away it was seen that at least fifty Japanese ',
    'had\nbeen killed and as many more wounded.\n\nTerror-stricken, the remainder of the army fled from the road along the\nocean to the rocks and hills beyond.\n\n"Give them another," ordered Captain Oscar, and it was quickly done, and\nthis brought down several more men, including the Japanese commander,\nwho had his head taken off just as he was about to order a rifle attack\non the strange sea monster that had attacked them.\n\nThe remainder of the Japanese took to the woods and inside of three\nminutes not a soldier was to be seen.\n\nCHAPTER VIII.\n\nTHE ACT OF A MADMAN.\n\n"I reckon we have given that army a setback," remarked Andy Greggs after\nthe contest was over.\n\n"Yes," answered the young captain of the new Holland.\n\n"But they ought not to be allowed to get to Havana, much less to land in\nFlorida."\n\n"What do you advise?"\n\n"Have you reported to Commodore Garrison yet?"\n\n"No; we were trying to find out what had become of you."\n\n"Then we will report first, and see what the commodore has to say."\n\nIt was easy to find the commodore\'s flagship, and they surprised the\nguard on deck by coming up directly at the side of the cruiser without\nanybody on board being aware that the new Holland was in the vicinity.\n\n"Hello, you!" cried the officer of the deck, when Oscar hailed him.\n\n"Yes, sir," answered the young captain, with a salute. "I could have\ntorpedoed you nicely had I wished."\n\n"You\'re the old Nick himself," growled the officer.\n\nCaptain Oscar Pelham\'s interview with Commodore Garrison was brief and\nto the point.\n\n"The new Holland has done more than well," said the commodore. "I don\'t\nbelieve that Japanese army will ever reach Havana. We have already three\nthousand soldiers there."\n\n"Then I presume our duty lies elsewhere."\n\n"It does. I have just received a message by wireless telegraphy asking\nif I can spare your boat to go to the coast of Canada. The Secretary of\nthe Navy was delighted to hear of the blowing up of the Tien-Tsin, and\nhe wishes you to help the warships which will ',
    'meet the British, French\nand German squadron off the coast of Canada. These warships are acting\nas an escort to some army transports carrying about a hundred thousand\nsoldiers, who wish to land in Canada." And the commodore gave the\ndetails so far as he knew them.\n\n"I will go to meet the American squadron in Canadian waters without\ndelay," answered Oscar, and bowed himself out of Commodore Garrison\'s\npresence.\n\nOnce again the submarine craft was put at her best speed and she went\nspinning through the ocean like a thing of life.\n\nSeveral days passed and they were making rapid progress northward, when\none night the new Holland came to a sudden halt.\n\nHer screws continued to revolve for a time, but soon they were clogged\nup and the power had to be stopped.\n\n"Now what is up?" cried Captain Oscar, as he leaped from the couch where\nhe had been sleeping.\n\nHis lieutenant could not tell, nor could the engineer.\n\nAccording to their charters no land was within fifty-six miles of the\nsubmarine craft.\n\nThe lights were turned on full and an examination made.\n\nIt showed that the new Holland had run into the Sargasso Sea, that dense\nmass of seaweed which floats along the Atlantic shore near and in the\nGulf Stream.\n\nThe weeds were so long and thick that the boat could not be budged. The\nscrews were tangled up completely, and for the time being the new\nHolland lay helpless.\n\nThe weeds pressed against the windows of the craft and through the mass\ndarted innumerable fish, some of the most ugly order Oscar had ever\nwitnessed. The larger fish were continually preying upon the smaller.\n\n"Let us try to ascend," said the young captain, and this they did, but\nwithout success. The weeds were above them as well as around them, and\nto try to go down under the mass only made matters worse, for many were\nfast to the very bottom of the ocean.\n\n"Here\'s a pickle truly," sighed Andy Greggs. "How far do you suppose\nthis Sargasso Sea extends?"\n\n"Humph! Perhaps for miles," answered Captain Oscar.\n\n"Well, ',
    'we\'ve got to do something."\n\n"We will do something," was the quiet answer. "We can\'t stay here."\n\n"It\'s only a question of expense, Andy."\n\n"I don\'t follow you."\n\n"I mean the expense of getting out."\n\n"How is money to get us out of this confounded mess?"\n\n"It will cost us the price of one dynamite bomb, placed just above and\nin front of the new Holland."\n\n"Oh! By ginger, I never thought of that. Oscar, you have a long head."\n\nThe young captain\'s plan was to float a bomb above and ahead of the new\nHolland, using one of the water-proof variety for the purpose.\n\nThis was done, and when the bomb was set off the dense seaweed was\nhurled in every direction.\n\nMeanwhile the screws were cleaned, and as soon as an opening appeared\nthe Holland shot upward into an open space fifty yards in extent.\n\nA searchlight was called into play, and by this they saw that the\nnearest open sea was to their right.\n\nBut they had to continue to fight the seaweed with long poles, and with\nmore shells, and even then it was nearly morning before they were clear\nof the mess.\n\n"That\'s an experience I hadn\'t bargained for," remarked Captain Oscar,\nas they sped once more on their way. "After this we must keep a better\nlookout." And they did.\n\nAt last they came in sight of the Canadian coast, and rounded Cape\nBreton into the Gulf of St. Lawrence.\n\nHere Captain Oscar Pelham reported to Admiral Fielding, who was in\ncommand of the warships stationed there.\n\n"I am glad to have you here," said the admiral. "We have a big fleet of\nships to contend with. They are lying twenty miles out to sea, awaiting\na favorable opportunity to attack us."\n\n"And what do you wish the new Holland to do, admiral?" asked the young\ncaptain.\n\n"Go out and do all the damage you can before they have a chance to get\nin here."\n\n"I will do the best I can, sir."\n\nOnce more the new Holland was off on her mission of death and\ndestruction.\n\nWith the crew went a pale-faced lieutenant from the admiral\'s flagship,\nsent on board to watch ',
    'proceedings.\n\nThe lieutenant\'s name was Raxtell, and Oscar did not at all like his\nlooks. Yet he said nothing and treated the lieutenant to all the\ncourtesy due his naval rank.\n\nBut that night Oscar could not sleep. Something worried him, he could\nnot tell what.\n\n"Something is wrong, and I know it," he muttered to himself, and,\nunknown to any of the others, began a tour of inspection.\n\nAll went well until he reached the magazine room in which the explosives\nwere stored.\n\nThen he heard a low chant, and looking in, saw a sight that caused his\nvery heart to stop beating.\n\nLieutenant Raxtell was there, with the look of a madman upon his\nghost-like face.\n\nHe had attached a long fuse to all of the dynamite bombs and was in the\nact of firing the explosives.\n\n------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nHE WAS IN THE ACT OF FIRING THE EXPLOSIVE.\n\n------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nShould they go off the new Holland would be blown to atoms!\n\nCHAPTER IX.\n\nANOTHER BLOWING UP.\n\nFor the moment after Captain Oscar Pelham made his terrible discovery\nthat Lieutenant Raxtell intended to blow up the new Holland he could\nneither move nor speak.\n\nHe clearly saw that the lieutenant was mad, but what had caused his\ninsanity was a mystery.\n\nHis face was like chalk, and his eyes rolled in a fashion horrible in\nthe extreme.\n\n"We will all go to heaven!" he heard the naval officer mutter. "All go\nto heaven—and that will be better than going home. Home! Ha! ha! So the\nadmiral would not give me shore leave? I will show him a trick or two!\nHere goes!"\n\n"Hold!"\n\nThe cry came from Oscar, and aroused as from a dream, he hurled himself\nupon the madman and bore him to the floor.\n\nFrothing at the mouth, Raxtell struggled desperately at first to free\nhimself and then to bite Oscar as might a wolf.\n\nBut the young commander of the new Holland was fighting for life, and\nheld him as in a vise of steel.\n\n"Let me go!" roared the madman. "Let me ',
    'go, or I will eat you up alive!"\n\n"Be calm, lieutenant," gasped Oscar. "Be calm. You are not well. Be\ncalm."\n\n"What\'s the row here?" came from the doorway, and Walton, the ammunition\nman, came in.\n\n"Quick, he is mad," answered Oscar. "Help me."\n\n"Mad! By Jove, captain, is it possible?"\n\nWalton hurled himself into the contest without hesitation, and between\nthe pair they speedily made Raxtell a close prisoner, binding him hands\nand feet, and fitting his face with a leather mask, that he might not\nbite himself or others.\n\nIt afterwards came out that the lieutenant was of a nervous disposition,\nand that homesickness had preyed upon his mind until his reason forsook\nhim.\n\nNothing could be done at present but keep him on board, and realizing\nthat the poor fellow was not accountable for what he had tried to do,\nCaptain Oscar treated him with every consideration.\n\nEarly in the morning of the next day the fleet of the enemy was\ndiscovered riding the ocean in a vast semi-circle.\n\nThe warships numbered thirty-four, and the transports sixty-six, and the\nsight was a truly imposing one.\n\n"We can\'t do much against that fleet," said Andy Greggs, after the new\nHolland had sunk out of sight.\n\n"We can do our share," responded the young captain.\n\nHe had his eyes on three ships of the enemy—the British cruiser\nTerrible, the German gunboat Wilhelm II., and the French\nship-of-the-line Philippe.\n\n"I\'ll sink all three, or know the reason why," he said to himself, and\nlaid his plans with great care.\n\nThe three ships he had in view were not over a quarter of a mile apart,\none from another, the Terrible being in the center.\n\nThis would necessitate a run of half a mile to reach all three warships.\n\nThe course of the new Holland was changed and they moved slowly and\ncautiously up to the Wilhelm II., keeping well under water all of the\ntime.\n\nWhile the run was being made Oscar held a consultation with the\nammunition man and with George Dross.\n\nIt was calculated that it would take five minutes to ',
    'run from one ship\nto another, and five minutes to adjust each of the several torpedoes.\n\nSoon the Wilhelm II. was gained, and in absolute silence the torpedo was\nfastened to her keel.\n\nOnly fish watched the movement and gazed curiously at the torpedo,\nagainst which they rubbed their slimy sides.\n\n"Set the fuse at half an hour," ordered Captain Oscar, and this was\ndone.\n\nFive minutes later they had gained the keel of the Terrible, and here a\ntorpedo was set at twenty minutes.\n\nThen a swift run was made for the Philippe, where they set a torpedo at\nten minutes.\n\n"Now run for it!" cried Captain Oscar, and the new Holland spun away,\nstraight into the Gulf of St. Lawrence.\n\nThe torpedoes had been set to go off at exactly half-past eleven, and it\nlacked but two minutes of that time when the new Holland shot to the\nsurface at a safe distance from the hostile fleet.\n\nBut the submarine boat was discovered and at once several torpedo-boats\nbelonging to the British set off to give her chase.\n\n"We are going to catch it from the little fellows," said Andy Greggs,\nwith a grim smile.\n\n"They won\'t reach us. We\'ll go down as soon as the explosion is over,"\nanswered Captain Oscar.\n\nHe held his chronometer in his hand and was counting off the seconds.\n\nThe time was up!\n\nAs he put the watch in his pocket a deafening roar rent the air, and the\nGerman warship was seen to rise in the air and then fall, a broken and\nshapeless mass upon the waters.\n\nThen came two other roars, one directly after the other, as the English\nvessel and the French ship-of-the-line caught it.\n\nThe explosion under the Philippe was the most perfect, for the craft was\nliterally split to bits, not alone by the torpedo, but by the explosions\nof her various magazines. Everybody on this ship was killed but a cabin\nboy, who leaped overboard at the first noise, and was picked up by one\nof the smaller warships.\n\nWith the Terrible it was different. The English cruiser was an unusually\nlarge one, and to have cut her to pieces ',
    'would have taken several\ntorpedoes.\n\nInside of two minutes she sank, the majority of her crew leaping\noverboard as she went down.\n\nSome of the sailors were caught in the suction created and went down\nwith the warship, never to rise again.\n\nAn explosion under the ocean added to the panic, and many were killed by\nthis.\n\nOver two hundred were floating around on the sea until other warships\ncame to their assistance and picked them up.\n\nThe blowing up of the three warships created consternation among the\nothers of the fleet, and signal after signal was displayed from the\ncommanding officer\'s flagship, all reading: "Clear for sea immediately;\na submarine torpedo-boat is among us. Double your watches."\n\nThen the entire fleet began to move for the broad Atlantic, chasing the\ntransports before them.\n\nThe torpedo-boats which had come out to do battle with the new Holland\nwere tremendously surprised to see the strange craft slide from view,\nand realizing that they themselves might be blown up at any instant,\nthey lost no time in running for their lives.\n\nThe new Holland could have given them plenty of trouble, but Captain\nOscar considered his ammunition too valuable to throw away on such\n"small fish," as he called them.\n\n"One of our torpedoes costs the government eight thousand six hundred\ndollars," he said. "Those little chaps aren\'t worth that to me. I am\nafter big guns."\n\nConsidering that the new Holland had done enough for the time being, and\nwishing to obtain a new supply of torpedoes and dynamite bombs, the\nyoung captain now turned back to the Gulf of St. Lawrence and reported\nto Admiral Fielding.\n\nThe admiral had witnessed the blowing up of the three warships through a\npowerful field glass which was stationed in an observation tower at the\ntop of the mainmast of the flagship, and he was highly delighted at the\nsuccess of the new Holland\'s work.\n\n"That craft is a marvel," he said. "The government must have more of\nthem."\n\n"It certainly would be a good thing," replied ',
    'Oscar. "I think I\'ve got\nthe enemy pretty well frightened. Perhaps they think we already have\nmore than one of these boats, having seen the work done in Cuban waters\nand now here."\n\n"Perhaps; and I hope they think we have a dozen. They will then imagine\ntheir costly warships of no value against such an enemy, and\nconsequently be glad to treat for peace."\n\nUsing the wireless telegraphy system on the admiral\'s flagship, Oscar\nsent word to Bridgeport arsenal to send him at once a large quantity of\ntorpedoes and dynamite bombs, and also a new style of bomb called\nhighite.\n\nHighite was a new explosive, of which much was expected. A highite shell\nwhen it exploded sent hundreds of little shells forth in a circle, which\nexploded an instant later.\n\n"That is what we ought to have had in Cuban waters," said Andy. "We\ncould then have made those Japanese sick."\n\nA week elapsed before the ammunition reached the new Holland and was\nstored on board.\n\nIn the meantime it was learned that the fleet of the enemy had turned\nsouthward, probably with the intention of landing on the New England\ncoast.\n\nThe fastest despatch boats in our naval service were sent out to watch\nthe enemy, and at the same time the new Holland was ordered southward,\nto be in readiness at any time the hostile fleet should show itself too\nclose to our shores.\n\nCHAPTER X.\n\nTHE FRAUDULENT MESSAGE.\n\nFour days later found the Holland lying snugly concealed in the waters\nof Cape Cod harbor.\n\nThe run to Boston had been made without a sight of the hostile fleet.\n\nAndy had gone ashore on a little business, and soon he came back from\nProvincetown wild with excitement.\n\n"Captain, this beats the Dutch!" he cried, as he entered the tiny cabin\nof the submarine craft.\n\n"What is it now, Andy? Another fleet in sight?"\n\n"Worse than that. The enemy is in Washington."\n\n"Washington!" roared the young captain, and leaped from his seat. "Do\nyou mean they have gotten soldiers into the country——"\n\n"Hold on; I said the enemy was in ',
    'Washington," interposed the young\nlieutenant. "I don\'t know how many of them are there, but enough to do a\nmean piece of work."\n\n"And what? Have they blown up the Capitol, or the White House?"\n\n"No; but they\'ve robbed the White House of its loveliest inmate."\n\n"You mean President Adams\' daughter——"\n\n"Has been kidnaped—carried off—last night—and nobody knows where to. The\nwhole country is wild with the news, and there is a reward up of a\nhundred thousand dollars for anybody who will bring her back safe and\nsound."\n\n"She\'s worth the money, too," added Captain Oscar, promptly. "Martha\nAdams is one of the sweetest girls in this country. How in the world was\nthe deed accomplished?"\n\n"Last night she was left home alone, the President being at a Cabinet\nmeeting, and Mrs. Adams being at a meeting for the benefit of disabled\nsoldiers. Two of the servants in charge of the President\'s apartments\nwere drugged and one stabbed in the back and killed. That is as much as\nis known now, excepting that two men were seen to hurry somebody in a\ncoach and drive off with her."\n\n"And in what direction did the coach go?"\n\n"Straight for the Potomac—and a boat was seen to leave and go down the\nriver an hour later."\n\n"Then she has been carried off to sea, beyond a doubt."\n\n"So I\'m thinking, and more than likely she is now a prisoner on one of\nthe foreign warships."\n\nThe captain of the new Holland scratched his head thoughtfully.\n\n"If she is on a warship, it must be either a Japanese or a Chinese\ncraft," he muttered.\n\n"Why so?"\n\n"Because I don\'t think England, France or Germany would stand for any\nsuch thing as that. It\'s heathens\' work, and nothing less—or private\nspite."\n\n"And why private spite?"\n\n"Oh, easily. Somebody may be mad because he didn\'t get a fat position\nfrom the President, or something like that. You know how much\nwire-pulling there is at Washington," concluded Oscar.\n\nThe news interested everybody, and when the papers came on board each\nread the reports on the case closely. But nothing new ',
    'had been learned,\nexcepting that it was practically certain Martha Adams had been carried\noff to some foreign warship lying off Chesapeake Bay.\n\n"I\'d like to catch the rascals who abducted her," sighed Captain Oscar,\nafter finishing the reading of the newspapers.\n\n"After the reward, eh?" laughed Andy.\n\n"Humph! I wasn\'t thinking of the reward. Martha Adams is the sweetest\ngirl I ever——" He broke off short, and as Andy looked at him closely he\nblushed in spite of himself.\n\nOscar had seen Martha Adams three times while the girl was at the\nshipyard with her father and others.\n\n"Oho! so that is how the wind blows," cried the lieutenant. "Well, it\'s\na long step to a President\'s daughter, captain, but who knows what\nyou\'ll be when this war is over—if the Holland XI. keeps on as she has\nbegun?"\n\n"Andy, you get on deck," came quickly, and the lieutenant did so, but\nwith a broad grin on his face. He knew that Oscar had met Martha Adams\nand had "gone sweet" on the President\'s only child in those days.\n\nLate on the following night a special messenger came on board of the\nHolland with orders for the submarine boat to move out to the east coast\nof Cape Cod, the locality being mentioned in detail.\n\nCaptain Oscar was much puzzled by the order, for it was entirely\nunexpected.\n\nYet there was nothing to do but to obey, and soon the new Holland was on\nher way out of Cape Cod Bay and heading first northeast and then\nsoutheast, outside of the cape.\n\n"This is strange," he said to the lieutenant. "I don\'t understand it."\n\n"Perhaps the navy department is afraid some foreign ship will crawl\nalong Cape Cod in the dark," suggested Andy.\n\n"Perhaps."\n\nThere the conversation ended, but still Captain Oscar was doubtful, he\nknew not why.\n\nHis experience with Raxtell, who had been put ashore at Boston, made him\nextremely cautious.\n\n"I didn\'t like the looks of that messenger," he mused. "He had a bad\neye."\n\nThe outside of the cape gained, it was a run of two miles to the spot\nmentioned in the ',
    'order.\n\n"Put on the searchlight and see that our way is perfectly clear," he\nsaid to the man who attended to the lights.\n\n"Aye, aye, cap\'n!" was the answer, and the powerful searchlight was made\nto do duty under the sea, bringing within its rays thousands of fish who\nknew not what to make of the unexpected glare.\n\nSoon Oscar found his way to the lookout.\n\nThe way seemed to be perfectly clear, and he was on the point of having\nthe speed of the submarine craft increased when something caught his eye\nwhich made him pause.\n\nThe Holland had glided into a fine netting made of copper wire.\n\nThe netting was shaped like a funnel, running down to a hole at the end\nnot quite as large in diameter as the width of the ship.\n\nHere was located a hidden mine, ready to go off the instant any moving\nbody of large size should strike it.\n\nHad the Holland kept on running the huge copper netting would have led\nthe submarine craft directly into the hole, the mine would have\nexploded, and that would have been the end of the craft and all on\nboard.\n\n"Back, quick!" cried Captain Oscar, and touched the button which\nconnected with the engine.\n\nThe screws were reversed, and the Holland XI. gave a shiver from stem to\nstern as her rapid head-way was checked.\n\nStill she went on, however, until the end of the hole was almost gained.\n\n"A mine!" shrieked the lookout. "We shall be blown up!"\n\n"All power backward!" cried Oscar to George Dross through a speaking\ntube. "Quick! It means life or death to us!"\n\nThe backward power was increased. Yet the Holland drifted closer and\ncloser, until her sharp prow was less than two feet away from the butt\nof the mine. Oscar held his breath. Another instant and they might all\nbe blown to pieces.\n\nBut then the forward motion ceased, the Holland gathered power in the\nopposite direction, and soon they had backed out of the huge copper net\nand were free!\n\n"What does this mean?" demanded Andy Greggs, as he crowded into the\nlookout.\n\n"It means two things," answered Oscar, ',
    'drawing a long sigh of relief.\n"In the first place we have had a close shave from death, and in the\nsecond place it means that the order to come here was fraudulent."\n\n"Then this was a trap set for us?"\n\n"Beyond a doubt. And I would just like to lay hands on that messenger."\nAnd Oscar grated his teeth.\n\n"Perhaps he is somewhere around, in a boat. Undoubtedly he was a foreign\nsympathizer."\n\n"We will go to the surface and see if any craft is in sight."\n\nGoing to the surface did not consume long, and the waters were swept by\nthe powerful searchlight.\n\nFar out from land was an English despatch boat.\n\n"I\'ll wager that is the messenger\'s ship," cried Oscar. "We\'ll run\ncloser and make sure."\n\nAgain they went down, and now the light was put out, and they swept up\nto the despatch boat as silently as a black ghost.\n\nWhen within a hundred yards of the craft they came up and the light was\nturned directly upon the despatch boat\'s deck.\n\nEvery man on the deck could be seen distinctly, and looking through his\nnight glass, Oscar made out a form he had seen before.\n\n"That messenger—and in the uniform of a lieutenant!" he cried.\n\nHe ordered the Holland below, but not before the despatch boat fired two\nfour-pounders at the submarine craft.\n\nThe four-pounders were powerless to hurt the Holland, further than to\nmake a dent in her starboard side.\n\n"Now for a quick revenge!" muttered the young captain. "Close those\nfront windows!"\n\nThose on board knew what that meant, and the order was quickly obeyed.\n\nThen the new Holland went forward at full speed.\n\nBang! crash; The despatch boat was hit fairly and squarely in the side\nand began to sink immediately.\n\nThe Holland withdrew, and Captain Oscar watched the result of the\nramming.\n\nDown went the English vessel and the most of her crew with her.\n\nA few tried to swim away, but the swell of the ocean was too strong for\nthem, and one after another sank to rise no more.\n\nThe new Holland had added another to her list of triumphs over ',
    'her\nenemies.\n\nCHAPTER XI.\n\nAN URGENT CALL FOR THE HOLLAND XI.\n\nEarly on the following morning the Holland went back to her old resting\nplace near Provincetown, and the young captain reported to his superiors\nwhat had occurred.\n\n"You have done well," said the commodore, who received his report. "You\nbeat them at their own game. But we must be very careful in the future,\nfor there may be more fraudulent messages afloat."\n\n"I would like to make a suggestion to the department," replied Oscar,\nmodestly.\n\n"What is it?"\n\n"Why not have every real message marked in some peculiar and secret\nmanner known only to those who can be trusted? Then every commander\nwould know at once whether a message was genuine or not."\n\n"An excellent suggestion," answered the commodore. "I will recommend\nthat this be done."\n\nLater on Oscar\'s plan was carried into effect, and by it three false\nmessengers were caught, and later on these men were hung as spies.\n\nNothing had been seen of the foreign fleet since they had run to sea,\nbut it was not long before the warships were discovered about thirty\nmiles outside of Boston harbor.\n\nThe new Holland was at once ordered to that vicinity, "To do as much\ndamage as possible," so the order read.\n\n"And we\'ll do it," said Captain Oscar. "They\'ll clear out for good when\nwe\'re done with them."\n\nBut alas! the best laid plans are sometimes miscarried by things really\nsmall in themselves.\n\nA small fishing smack one night came in the bay and anchored directly\nabove the Holland.\n\nWhen the Holland started to move, the anchor of the fishing smack got\ntangled up in one of the submarine boat\'s screws.\n\nThe result was the wrecking of the screw and the grinding of the anchor\ninto powder. Those on the fishing smack were scared almost to death,\nthinking there was an earthquake going on under the boat.\n\nAndy Greggs was in despair, but not so Oscar.\n\n"No use crying over spilt milk," said the young captain. "We must get\nthat screw repaired without delay."\n\nAnd he had the Holland XI. towed over to ',
    'the Charlestown Navy Yard.\n\nThe accident put a damper on the enthusiasm of the navy department, for\nmuch had been looked for from the new Holland.\n\nBut the enemy was close at hand and must be met, and Admiral Fielding\ngathered a squadron of twenty-six cruisers and gunboats for that\npurpose. With this squadron went two of the regular torpedo-boat\ndestroyers.\n\nMore warships were telegraphed for from New York, but it would take\nthese vessels two days to reach the scene of battle.\n\nThe squadron sailed out at night, with everybody in the best of spirits.\n\nIt was felt that one of the greatest battles of the war was at hand.\n\n"We\'ll smash every one of the enemy!" cried one old salt, "just as Dewey\nsmashed the Spanish warships in Manila Bay."\n\n"And Schley smashed the Spaniards in Santiago harbor!" added another\njackie.\n\nAnd so the talk ran on until morning dawned.\n\nIt was expected that the enemy would be in sight, but not a single ship\nwas to be seen anywhere.\n\n"This is remarkable," said Admiral Fielding. And he at once sent some\nscouting craft ahead to find out what had become of the foreign vessels.\n\nThe scouts came back at nightfall and reported that the foreigners were\nrunning up to the coast of Maine. The enemy was making for Casco Bay,\noff the city of Portland.\n\nAt once began a chase after the foreign ships which lasted all of that\nnight and up to noon of the next day.\n\nThen the American cruisers Vermont and Canada came up to the rear guard\nof the enemy and opened fire without delay.\n\nInside of half an hour a fierce battle was in progress, with\ntwenty-eight warships on the American side, and thirty-two on the side\nof the allies.\n\nThe din was terrific, as broadside after broadside was poured forth from\none ship or another.\n\nThe first vessel to go down in the dreadful encounter was the German\ncruiser Berlin. She was quickly followed by the Italian gunboat Carlos\nII. and the French frigate Siene. In the meantime one of the British\ncruisers had caught fire and was burning ',
    'fiercely.\n\nBut now the Americans began to catch it, and presently the cruiser Utah\ntook fire. Her magazines blew up, and this set fire to the Tennessee,\nwhich happened to be close at hand when the explosion occurred.\n\nIn the van of the fight was the noble Oregon, with the Brooklyn beside\nher. These old ships had done wonders in the Spanish-American war, and\nthey were now adding nobly to their laurels.\n\nTo the right of the line, the New Jersey was having a sort of private\nduel with the English cruiser Windsor. The Windsor had pumped three\nten-inch shells into the New Jersey, but still our cruiser held her own,\nand let drive with two of her thirteen-inch guns. Both shots hit below\nthe water-mark, and the Windsor slowly sunk, many of her crew swimming\nto the neighboring warships.\n\nTo the left of the line was the New York, fighting two French ships\nwhose names could not be ascertained. The Frenchmen were plucky, and\npoured shot and shell hotly into the New York. But presently one was\nsunk by a ten-inch shell, and rushing around in a semi-circle, the New\nYork managed to ram the second, nearly cutting her in two.\n\nBut now more foreign ships were coming up and the fight became hotter\nthan ever, until the surface of the sea was filled with nothing but\nwaterspouts and thick clouds of smoke. At times but little could be\nseen, and it is no doubt that on more than one occasion a friendly ship\nfired into one of its comrades without knowing it.\n\nBut though the American ships were doing nobly, it was seen by nightfall\nthat the battle was slowly but surely going against them. They still had\nsixteen ships fit for service, but the other foreign war vessels had\ncome up, and the good ships on the other side numbered twenty-six, just\nten more. The newly arrived warships were big ones, and the outlook for\nthe Americans became blacker and blacker.\n\n"If only we had the new Holland here," sighed Admiral Fielding. "I\nbelieve she could turn the scales in our favor when morning comes."\n\nBy ',
    'the wireless telegraph he sent a message ashore to Portland, which\nwas immediately transmitted to the Charlestown Navy Yard.\n\nSoon this message came back:\n\n"Have just finished repairs and am at your service.\n\n"Oscar Pelham,\n"Captain, commanding Holland XI."\n\n"Good!" cried the admiral, and then he sent this massage in reply:\n\n"Come to Casco Bay instantly, and do all the damage you can."\n\n"We are off for Casco Bay!" cried the young captain to his lieutenant.\n\n"The call looks important," answered Andy.\n\n"It is important. There has been a big battle, and it looks as if our\nfleet was almost knocked out."\n\n"By Jove! Then we are wanted, and no mistake."\n\nBoston harbor was soon left behind, and they stood up the New England\ncoast.\n\n"Crowd on all power!" said the young captain to the engineer. "Don\'t\nspare anything. This run may prove the run of our lives."\n\nAnd power was crowded on, until the Holland XI. quivered with an energy\nthat seemed to endow her with life.\n\nSlowly the night went by, and when morning came it found the submarine\nboat in sight of the great battle ground.\n\nThe foreign ships were hammering the Americans as never before, and\nmatters were going badly with the upholders of Old Glory.\n\n"Here is where we make a record for ourselves, or die in the attempt!"\ncried Captain Oscar. "We must turn that defeat into victory. Let every\nman do his duty to the utmost. Down we go, Dross."\n\nAnd down plunged the new Holland into the ocean on her course of\ndestruction and death.\n\nCHAPTER XII.\n\nDEFEAT TURNED INTO VICTORY.\n\nCaptain Oscar Pelham knew that whatever was to be done must be done\nquickly.\n\nIn the terrific naval battle now in progress the Americans were getting\nthe worst of it fast.\n\nShip after ship was either going down or burning up and thousands of\nbrave lives had already been sacrificed.\n\nOfficers and men were doing their best to hold their own, but the\nforeign fleet was so much larger, that defeat appeared inevitable.\n\nThe first warship the Holland attacked was a ',
    'British armored cruiser\nwhich was pounding our own Iowa III.\n\nThe Iowa was suffering from several big gaps in her larboard side, but\nstill fought on desperately.\n\nUnder the British cruiser sunk the Holland XI. a torpedo was rapidly\nadjusted, and then the submarine craft ran away with all speed.\n\nSome sixteen-inch guns had just been trained on the Iowa III. and the\nEnglish gunners were about to set off the pieces when a deep rumble was\nheard, like an earthquake, and up went the British cruiser into a\nmillion atoms.\n\nThe explosion was a surprise to everybody. The Holland had, so far not\nshown herself and it was thought by friends and foes alike that the\nBritish warship had been the victim of her own magazines.\n\nThose on board might have told a different story, but all were either\nkilled outright or drowned in the awful wreckage which followed.\n\n"Number One!" cried Captain Oscar. "Now for Number Two!"\n\nClose at hand lay a broad-beamed French ship, the Coronet, carrying a\nnewly-invented battery of dynamite guns.\n\nAnother torpedo was quickly adjusted here and an explosion as loud as\nthe first followed. The Coronet, however, was not blown to pieces, but\nsuffered a hole in her bottom four feet long and three feet wide.\nThrough this the ocean poured with the power of a Niagara, and swiftly\nthe Frenchman sank from view, leaving her dead and dying scattered in\nall directions. Some of these sailors were picked up and they told of\nthe explosion from the bottom, and then the foreigners knew a submarine\ncraft was at work.\n\nThis explosion also revealed to Admiral Fielding the true state of\naffairs.\n\n"Nothing but a torpedo from the Holland XI. could have done that!" he\ncried. "She is among us and is doing nobly. The day will be ours after\nall!" And the old salt almost fell to dancing a jig.\n\nThe news was quickly communicated from ship to ship and all felt the\ninspiration of the Holland\'s presence.\n\nTo the northward two big German cruisers had cornered the Virginia, a\ngunboat of fair ',
    'size.\n\nThe Virginia was fighting desperately, but the German men-\'o-war were\nslowly but surely driving the American ship on a low-lying reef.\n\n"We will fight to the last," said the commander of the Virginia. "A man\ncan die but once and what more noble than to give up one\'s life for his\ncountry!" And his men cheered him loudly.\n\nCaptain Oscar had noted this state of affairs, and as soon as the\nCoronet was disposed of he made after the two German vessels.\n\nAs he came closer, he noticed the two ships moving up side by side, as\nif their commanders were consulting together.\n\n"I\'ll end that consultation," he muttered, and ordered that a torpedo be\nshot out directly between them.\n\nWizz! went the huge instrument of death, and as it struck the side of\none of the German warships it went off with a terrific noise, tearing\ngreat holes in both vessels.\n\nThe ships were not sunk, but consternation now reigned supreme, for both\nwere in danger of sinking.\n\n"Hurrah!" yelled the jackies on board the Virginia. "Hurrah! The new\nHolland is at hand. The fight is ours!" And then the Virginia went into\nthe contest with new vigor, which speedily placed the two foreign ships\ncompletely at her mercy. The Holland did not wait to see the end of the\nstruggle, but ran back to where the sea battle was still at its hottest.\n\nTo the northward four American warships had been cornered by eight\nforeign ships and shot and shell were raining down as never before.\nComing to the surface to get a good view of the situation, the young\ncommander of the new Holland ordered that two of the new highite bombs\nbe thrown at the largest of the enemy\'s vessels.\n\nThe bombs were aimed with great accuracy and did fearful execution, one\nalmost clearing a deck of all the men standing upon it, while\nsmoke-stacks and riggings went flying in all directions.\n\nThen the Holland XI. sank below, but not before one of the Allies\'\nwarships had sent a thirteen-inch solid shot over her bow.\n\n"Phew! But that was close!" muttered Andy ',
    'Greggs. "A foot nearer and we\nwould have had a pretty good-sized hole into us."\n\n"We must expect to get hit sooner or later," answered Oscar. "Every one\nof the enemy is laying for us. They would rather sink us than capture\nour largest armored cruiser."\n\n"To be sure, for the Holland XI. is more deadly to them than a score of\ncruisers."\n\nThe Holland now turned her attention to several Italian and Turkish\nvessels which were guarding the enemy\'s transports, far to the eastward.\n\n"If we make a demonstration against the transports those cruisers in\nfront will have to run back to protect them," said Captain Oscar. "It\'s\na pity to sink the soldiers who haven\'t had a chance to fight, but it\'s\ngot to be done."\n\nThe attention of the Holland was first turned to the Turkish man-\'o-war,\nthat being the nearest. It was crowded with Turkish soldiers and\nsailors, their bright-red uniforms standing out boldly in the sunlight.\n\nA time torpedo was attached to the Turkish ship, and before it went off\nanother torpedo was attached to the Italian corvette. Then the Holland\nwent for the nearest transport, one carrying nearly two thousand foreign\nsoldiers of various nationalities.\n\nBang! crash! boom! went the torpedoes, and as the Turkish and the\nItalian ships sailed skyward, the Holland hurled two highite and one\ndynamite bomb at the transport.\n\nThe execution was horribly perfect, for the upper deck of the transport,\ncrowded with soldiers, was literally swept clean; men, deckhouse, masts,\nsails, smoke-stacks, everything being hurled into the sea. A\nblood-curdling yell went up, and instantly the steam whistles of\nnumerous other transports sounded a note of warning.\n\nIt was the beginning of the end and that end was triumph for the\nAmericans.\n\nBut the victory had been dearly bought, and would have been a defeat had\nit not been for the timely arrival of the wonderful Holland XI.\n\nBy night what was left of the Allies\' fleet had withdrawn to the\ndarkness of the Atlantic Ocean.\n\nWhat a celebration ',
    'there was when the news of the victory reached land!\n\nBells were rung, cannon fired, bonfires lit, and the people went almost\ncrazy.\n\nThe name of the Holland XI. was on every lip, and everybody spoke of her\nyoung inventor and commander, Oscar Pelham.\n\n"A wonderful young man," said President Adams. "He will assuredly make\nhis mark in the world, indeed he has already done so."\n\nHe telegraphed his congratulations to the fleet at large and sent an\nextra message of thanks to Oscar, which pleased all on board of the\nsubmarine ship very much.\n\nYet the President was very sad.\n\nHe could not forget that his daughter, his only child, was in the hands\nof the enemy.\n\nThe shock had been severe upon Mrs. Adams and she was now sick in bed\nand not likely to get up for a long time to come.\n\nIt must not be supposed that the strain of the great naval contest had\nnot told upon the Holland.\n\nHer machinery had been taxed to the utmost and needed overhauling, and\nseveral of her plates had to be re-riveted. Besides this, she needed\nanother supply of ammunition.\n\nShe accordingly put back to Boston and to the Charlestown Navy Yard,\nwhere the repairs were made with all possible speed.\n\nA week passed and all remained quiet.\n\nThen came news which was calculated to fill the stoutest heart with\ndread.\n\nA fleet of fifty Chinese, Japanese and Russian warships had set sail for\nAsiatic waters, bound, so it was surmised, for the western coast of the\nUnited States.\n\nThe fleet would probably try to enter the Golden Gate and bombard San\nFrancisco and Oakland!\n\nThese twin cities now rivaled New York in size and their commercial\nvalue was enormous.\n\nDuring the past ten years thousands of Chinamen had been driven from San\nFrancisco and other cities of California, and this made the Celestials\nwild to gain a footing in what had once been their beloved Chinatown.\n\nSoon came a message for Captain Oscar Pelham:\n\n"You are wanted immediately on the pacific coast. If you do not come we\nare doomed.\n\n"Chester."\n\nAlvin ',
    'Chester was the Admiral in command of the Pacific Squadron of our\nnavy. He was a fighter to the core and had been well acquainted with\nOscar\'s father.\n\n"Wanted, eh?" mused the young captain of the new Holland. "All right,\nwe\'ll go."\n\n"But how are you going?" demanded Andy. "It will take a long while to\nsail around Cape Horn."\n\n"We will go by the way of the Central American Canal," answered the\nyoung captain.\n\nCHAPTER XIII.\n\nTHE CENTRAL AMERICAN CANAL.\n\nThe great canal, in Central America, had just been completed by the\nUnited States at a cost of thirty-six millions of dollars.\n\nOther nations, especially France, had tried to push a canal through for\nyears, but had failed.\n\nThe United States now controlled all the land in the vicinity of the\ncanal, and, as previously stated, thought seriously of taking these\nCentral American States into our glorious union.\n\n"Can we get through the canal?" questioned Andy.\n\n"Yes. I figured it out long ago—when I thought we might be needed on the\nwestern coast."\n\n"Captain, you have a long head."\n\n"Thanks, Andy, no compliments. Let\'s go to dinner." And there the\nsubject was dismissed.\n\nThirty-six hours later found the new Holland on her way southward.\n\nCuba was passed without special incident and then they ran into the\nCaribbean Sea.\n\nAt the canal entrance a special message awaited them, urging them to\ncome on with all possible speed.\n\n"The enemy are coming to the western coast as fast as they can," said\nOscar, after reading the message to Andy. "It is feared that they intend\nto bombard the Hawaiian Islands on the way over, and capture Honolulu\nand other important seaport towns."\n\n"Can\'t we head them off?"\n\n"Perhaps that is what we will be called upon to do," answered the young\ncaptain of the Holland XI.\n\nThe weather was very hot everywhere and in the interior of the submarine\ncraft it was stifling.\n\n"This isn\'t so much fun," grumbled old George Dross. "I expect some day\nyou\'ll find nothing but a grease spot left o\' me."\n\n"All right, ',
    'George, we\'ll give the spot decent burial," answered Oscar,\ndryly, and then a laugh went up.\n\nWith no time to lose, preparations were made to go through the great\ncanal with all speed.\n\nIn the meantime the enemy heard of the proposed trip and it caused all\nforeign nations to worry a good deal.\n\nThey knew that if once the new Holland got into the Pacific Ocean she\ncould do incalculable damage to their warships.\n\nA plot was at once instituted to blow up several of the canal locks,\nthus rendering the artificial waterway useless.\n\nThis was to be accomplished when the Holland was half way to the Pacific\nside, so that the submarine craft might be left high and dry some\nseventy miles from either coast.\n\nTen miles from the Atlantic coast entrance, or more particularly the\nCaribbean Sea entrance, the Holland put up for a few hours at the town\nof Ambrose, a Spanish settlement.\n\nOscar went ashore for despatches and with him went Andy, glad to have\nthe chance of stretching his legs on Mother Earth once more.\n\nThe despatches filled Oscar with suspicion, for there was one from the\nPacific end of the canal which read as follows:\n\n"Be on your guard, or the Holland XI. will suffer while coming through\nthe canal."\n\n"Humph! Now what does that mean?" muttered the young captain.\n\n"It means that there is more deviltry afoot," answered his lieutenant.\n"We must be wide-awake. Perhaps the Spaniards down here are not so\nfriendly as they would like to appear."\n\nFeeling hungry, the pair entered a restaurant not far from the edge of\nthe canal.\n\nThey sat close to an open window and while eating, caught some talk of\nthree Spaniards who rested in a small boat directly under the window.\n\nThe talk was about the new Holland, and Oscar gathered that the\nforeigners were far from friendly to the craft.\n\n"I vish she vas sunk," growled one Spaniard.\n\n"Perhaps your vish vill come true, Carlos," said a second Spaniard.\n"Remember, Pargloss ees vide awake."\n\n"And Pargloss ees a vonderful man," added the third ',
    'Spaniard.\n\nThen the three rowed away in the darkness.\n\n"Who can this Pargloss be?" mused Captain Oscar.\n\n"I don\'t know. There used to be a Nathan Pargloss in the Treasury\nDepartment, but he was kicked out on account of some crookedness."\n\n"Then perhaps he is the man, Andy. Perhaps he wants to get square with\nthe United States."\n\nThe young captain had struck the nail on the head.\n\nNathan Pargloss was furious because he had been discharged from a\nposition paying five thousand dollars per year.\n\nHe was a dishonest man and for years had been in sympathy with Spain and\nother foreign nations.\n\nHe had sold valuable treasury secrets to foreigners and the discovery of\nthese actions had caused his dismissal.\n\nIt was he who had concocted the scheme to blow up two of the canal locks\nwhen the new Holland should reach about the middle of the long\nwater-course.\n\nAll of the next day Oscar thought of Nathan Pargloss and of what the\nSpaniards had said.\n\nWhen the second lock was gained he spoke to the keeper about Pargloss.\n\n"Ha! I heard of him only yesterday!" cried the keeper. "He is around\nhere somewhere."\n\n"Then we must set a trap and catch him," returned Oscar, decidedly. "I\ncannot risk the loss of the Holland at such an important time as this."\n\nIt was decided to set a close watch all along the canal.\n\nTrustworthy men were hired at Oscar\'s expense, the young captain knowing\nfull well that the Navy Department would reimburse him for any outlay\nthus made.\n\nThe plan worked well, for about midnight a small boat was seen to\napproach the lock.\n\nIt contained two men, Pargloss and a confederate.\n\nPargloss\' craft contained a large can of dynamite and this was placed\nclose to the gate of the lock.\n\nPargloss was about to depart when Oscar and several men fell upon him.\n\n"Halt!" ordered the young captain of the new Holland, and aimed a pistol\nat Pargloss\' head.\n\nThe wretched man, however, was game, and he flung himself upon the young\ncaptain and both tumbled over the brink of the lock into ',
    'the waters\nbelow.\n\nPargloss had Oscar by the neck and the young captain was in peril of\neither being choked to death or drowned.\n\nOscar tried to free himself but in vain.\n\nPargloss was a powerful man and could not be made to let go.\n\nIn desperation, Oscar pulled the trigger of his pistol.\n\nHe scarcely expected the weapon to go off, but it did, and the bullet\nstruck Pargloss in the shoulder.\n\nThe man was not seriously injured, but the sudden pain made him loosen\nhis hold and in another instant Oscar was free.\n\nComing to the surface he reached a ladder running up the side of the\nlock and soon found himself once more above the canal.\n\nIn the meantime, Pargloss\' confederate had been made a close prisoner by\nthe others.\n\n"Where is Pargloss?" asked Andy.\n\n"In the canal. Watch for him, he must soon come up."\n\nThey did watch, and in a few seconds the criminal appeared and gazed\naround him savagely.\n\n"Come up out of there!" ordered Oscar. "If you don\'t you are a dead\nman!"\n\n"I defy you! You shall never capture me!" shrieked Pargloss, and dove\nout of sight again.\n\nTen minutes passed, but he did not come up.\n\nThey watched in vain, running up and down the canal bank and bringing\nmany torches to bear upon the scene.\n\n"He went under to stay under," was Andy\'s sober comment.\n\nEarly in the morning they dragged the canal, and at the bottom came upon\nPargloss\' body.\n\nRather than give himself up he had clung fast to an old tree stump and\nthus drowned himself!\n\nCHAPTER XIV.\n\nCAST UPON THE SHORE.\n\nForty-eight hours later found the Holland XI. out in the Pacific Ocean,\non her way to the Golden Gate.\n\nThe death of Pargloss and the capture of his confederate had put a\ndamper on other plans to tamper with the Central American Canal, and no\ntrouble was experienced in finishing the journey.\n\nArriving in San Francisco, Oscar was much surprised to receive what was\nlittle short of an ovation by the citizens.\n\nAll had heard of the wonderful work done by the new Holland and all\nwished to see the ',
    'craft, her young commander and her brave crew.\n\nBut time was precious and the submarine boat remained in San Francisco\nBay but a few hours.\n\nA cablegram had come from the Far East, that the Hawaiian Islands were\nto be attacked and that the enemy wanted to use Honolulu as a base of\nsupplies.\n\nAt that time, Honolulu, the capital of the islands, had grown to be a\ncity of three hundred thousand inhabitants. Many of the people were\nAmericans and much of the money invested there had come from California.\n\nThe Holland was soon bound for Honolulu, and this made a run of nearly\nten days for the craft.\n\n"Now we are getting into the territory of earthquakes," remarked Andy.\n"I wonder what a strong under-water earthquake would do to us?"\n\n"I don\'t think I would care to experience an earthquake," replied Oscar.\n"We are having lively times enough fighting the enemy."\n\nThe run to the Hawaiian Islands was made without trouble of any kind,\nexcepting that the weather was hot and they had to come to the surface\nof the ocean every night to get cooled off.\n\nThe harbor of Honolulu is an ideal one, situated behind a high series of\nrocks called Diamond Head.\n\nWhen the Holland came into view of Diamond Head, not a native vessel of\nany sort was in sight.\n\n"By Jove!" cried Oscar, suddenly. "Look!"\n\nHe pointed to the very top of Diamond Head.\n\nFrom a tall flagpole situated there, floated a large flag of red, black,\nyellow and blue.\n\nIt was the standard used by the Allies!\n\n"The enemy have captured the Islands!" ejaculated Andy.\n\nHis words were true.\n\nJust three days before the new Holland reached there, the fleet of\nwarships from Asiatic waters had arrived in front of Honolulu and\ndemanded an immediate and unconditional surrender.\n\nThe authorities would not surrender and the three American warships in\nthe harbor, along with the shore forts, had done their best to hold the\nenemy at bay.\n\nBut it was a vastly unequal contest from the start, and before sundown,\nthe three American ships were ',
    'annihilated, the forts reduced to ruins,\nand the capital taken by main force.\n\nFor many years the Chinese had been very bitter against the Hawaiians,\nfor they had been thrown out of the island States after Hawaii was\nannexed, and now when they came ashore from their warships they did\neverything they dared to make it unpleasant for the inhabitants.\n\nHad it not been for the Russians, every man, woman and child of Hawaiian\nbirth would have been butchered.\n\nThe majority of the foreign fleet had now sailed to capture other\nseaports on the islands.\n\nEight big men-o\'-war, however, lay close in Honolulu harbor, keeping\nwatch over the town.\n\nWatching his chance that night, Oscar went ashore, and from several\nAmericans gained a full knowledge of what had occurred.\n\n"We would still fight, were the outlook more hopeful," said one of the\nAmericans, a Custom House official.\n\n"We will make it more hopeful," answered Oscar, grimly. "By morning not\nmany foreign warships will be seen in this harbor."\n\nThe young captain hurried back to the Holland and the submarine craft\nimmediately sank out of sight and came around Diamond Head into the\nharbor. By the aid of a powerful glass they made out the location of the\nenemy\'s ships with ease.\n\nThen Oscar paid a long visit to the ammunition room and where a number\nof torpedoes were adjusted, and also a number of dynamite and highite\nbombs.\n\nThe foreign ships rode at anchor, so that the bombs and torpedoes could\nbe set off by means of a wire charged with electricity instead of the\ntime fuses.\n\n"They shall all go up together," said the young captain. "It will be the\ngreatest blow-up of the age."\n\nAgain he sent word ashore, stating that all Americans must keep away\nfrom the water front between the hours of seven and eight o\'clock the\nnext morning.\n\nAt midnight the Holland began to move around the bottom of Honolulu\nharbor, adjusting the torpedoes and bombs.\n\nThe bombs were concealed in seaweed and floated on top of the water,\nclose beside the ships they ',
    'were to destroy.\n\nBy six o\'clock in the morning every instrument of destruction was in\nposition, and all attached to the fatal electric wire.\n\nThose on board of the Holland were exhausted by their work, yet nobody\nthought of going to sleep.\n\nAn early breakfast was had and then the Holland ran out of the harbor as\nfar as the length of the electric wire permitted.\n\nWatching the foreign ships, Captain Oscar saw the sailors stirring and\nthen heard the roll-calls sounding.\n\nThe warships were crowded with Chinese, Japanese and Russians.\n\nThese commanders had ordered fresh meat and vegetables to be brought on\nboard their vessels at half-past seven, and when no native lighters came\nout with the things they grew very angry.\n\n"We are not to be disobeyed!" stormed one Chinese commander. "If that\nfood is not forthcoming quickly, I will go ashore and fire the accursed\ncity."\n\nSimilar threats were made by the other commanders, and by quarter to\neight some of them prepared to leave their ships, to put their threats\ninto execution.\n\n"We will let them get ashore," said Oscar to his companions. "They will\nmake good prisoners."\n\nThe foreign commanders went ashore with much pomp, and hurried to the\nCustom House to see why their commands had not been obeyed.\n\nOscar had ordered that any foreigners ashore should be made prisoners,\nyet as the warships still rode unmolested in the harbor, the Americans\nat the Government Building knew not what to do.\n\nIf they made the commanders prisoners, and the plan of those on board of\nthe Holland failed, it would go bad with the city people.\n\nBut at ten minutes to eight came what appeared to be a terrific\nearthquake.\n\nThere was a noise like a sharp crash of thunder, followed by broad\nsheets of fire playing across Honolulu harbor, and then those at a\ndistance saw several of the foreign warships flying skyward and\ntownward, blown into atoms.\n\nThe air was filled with debris and the streets of Honolulu and the\nhousetops were covered with bits of wreckage. In ',
    'some instances the\nwreckage was on fire and produced other fires in the city, but these\nwere rapidly extinguished.\n\nThe native Hawaiian thought the end of the world had come and some of\nthe most superstitious of them ran hither and thither, shrieking in\nterror.\n\nThe explosion shook the Custom House and broke some of the glass in the\nwindows.\n\n"Ha! What does that mean?" demanded one of the Chinese officers, who had\ncome ashore.\n\n"It means that your ship is blown up and that you are our prisoner!"\nanswered one of the Americans, and pointed a pistol squarely at his\nhead.\n\nA wild scene followed, but the foreigners were outnumbered and soon all\neight of those who had come ashore were made prisoners, and cast into\none of the dungeons of the old fort. The sailors who had been left in\ncharge of the small boats at the dock were either killed by the shock of\nthe explosions, or shot down by sharpshooters stationed at a distance.\n\nThe annihilation of many of the foreign warships was complete, and when\nthe wreckage and the smoke cleared away, nothing remained in the harbor\nbut several sunken hulks, the other ships having lost no time in\nleaving. The lives of all on board the sunken ships were also destroyed.\n\nOscar came ashore at ten o\'clock and the Americans nearly hugged the\nyoung captain to death.\n\n"You have saved us!" said one of the number. "That was the greatest move\nI ever witnessed in my life!"\n\n"Now we must watch for the return of the other warships," said the young\ncaptain.\n\nBut he first wanted some more torpedoes. Fortunately these were close at\nhand, for Honolulu was an American base of supplies for warships sailing\nbetween San Francisco and the Philippines.\n\nThat afternoon found the Holland lying off shore about two miles from\nthe city.\n\nIt was rumored that seven other foreign ships were coming, but so far\nthey were still out of sight.\n\nSuddenly a strange rumble rent the air, coming from the depths of the\nsea.\n\nThe terrific explosion of the morning had loosened ',
    'some rocks of the\nreefs outside of the harbor and now followed a regular under-water\nearthquake.\n\nThe disturbance was a violent one, and brought on a tidal wave which\narose to a height of fifteen feet.\n\n"Hi, look!" screamed Andy to Oscar.\n\nBoth were on the deck of the Holland at the time, and before they could\ngo below the craft was caught by the tidal wave and carried rapidly\ntoward shore.\n\nOver the beach swept the wave, carrying the Holland with it, a distance\nof two hundred feet and more.\n\nThen the wave went down almost as suddenly as it had arisen, and the\nyoung captain found his submarine craft high and dry on the rocks, three\nhundred feet from water deep enough to float her!\n\nThere was great confusion on board, and in the midst of this came\nanother alarm.\n\n"The foreign warships are in sight! They have spotted us and are running\nthis way!"\n\nCHAPTER XV.\n\nTIDAL WAVES AND WHALES.\n\nIt was a perilous situation, of this there could be no doubt.\n\nThe tidal wave had cast the Holland XI. high and dry on the Hawaiian\nshore, where she lay as helpless as a whale on a grassy plain.\n\nIn the offing loomed up three foreign warships, a Chinese, a Japanese\nand a Russian.\n\nThe enemy had already sighted the new Holland, and were drawing closer\nto the curious-looking craft.\n\nThe submarine boat had landed on the shore right side up, and Captain\nOscar Pelham and Lieutenant Andy Greggs had just come to the little deck\nto view the situation.\n\n"We are knocked out this trip," groaned Andy. "As soon as they learn who\nwe are they\'ll throw a shell this way and that will finish us."\n\n"Let us see if we can\'t train one of our guns on them," suggested the\nyoung captain.\n\nThe word was passed and it was found that one gun could be trained on\nthe Russian warship, which was coming up from the southward.\n\nThe gun was loaded with a highite bomb and at the proper moment was\ntouched off.\n\nBoom!\n\nLoud and clear the sound echoed over the Pacific Ocean and the shell\nexploded close to the deck of the Russian ',
    'warship, causing death and\ndestruction upon every hand.\n\nThe effect of the awful shot was soon apparent, for those left on the\nwarship lost no time in turning the vessel about and sailing out of\nrange.\n\nThe shot, however, was noticed by those on the Japanese and the Chinese\ncruisers, and soon they came in and let fly at the Holland XI.\n\nOne solid shot plowed up the sand in front of the submarine craft, while\nseveral others struck the rocks behind, causing a shower of stones to\ncover the craft as with flying hail.\n\n"By Jove! But this is dangerous!" muttered Oscar. He turned to his men.\n"What do you wish to do, remain here or leave the Holland XI. and take\nto yonder wood?"\n\n"We\'ll do what you do," answered old George Dross.\n\n"I will never desert the Holland XI.!" answered the young captain,\ncalmly.\n\n"Neither will I!" added Andy.\n\n"We\'ll all stay!" came in a shout. "Hurrah for Uncle Sam! We\'ll get the\nbest of \'em yet!"\n\n"Give them another shell," went on Oscar. "Even if it doesn\'t hit them\nit may make them keep their distance."\n\nThe shell was soon sent forth, but the enemy was out of range and the\nbomb did no further damage than to land in the body of a shark sporting\nin the offing.\n\nThen the three foreign ships got together and concocted a scheme to\nbombard the new Holland from three different points at the same time.\n\nSoon shot and shell were raining all around the submarine craft.\n\nOne shell struck so close it smashed out one of the side windows,\nsending a shower of glass and sand into the little cabin.\n\n"This is hot!" cried Andy, and of a sudden came a yell from a man at the\nstern window, which was pointed out to sea.\n\n"The water! The water!" yelled the lookout. "It is rising again."\n\nHis words were followed by another rumble, similar to that which they\nhad before experienced, and looking toward the ocean all saw another\ntidal wave sweeping toward the shore.\n\n"Close up the deck!" ordered Oscar, hurriedly. "And, Marken, get some\nsort of cover for that broken ',
    'window."\n\nThen the young captain turned to the old engineer.\n\n"We must take advantage of that wave when it strikes us," he said. "We\nare lying stern to the ocean. If we get afloat, start her backward with\nall power."\n\n"Aye, aye!" answered George Dross.\n\nSoon the sea could be heard rushing up the sand and then they found the\nnew Holland rocking from side to side. But the water only came up to her\nwindows and the submarine craft did nothing but slip a dozen feet closer\nto the Pacific.\n\n"Left!" muttered Andy, in disgust. "That wave was not strong enough."\n\n"Another is coming!" cried Oscar. "By Jove, look!"\n\nFar out to sea they saw the ocean becoming white with foam, while a very\nmountain of water loomed up. It had struck the Chinese cruiser and that\nship had keeled over and lay a wreck in the boiling sea.\n\nThen the mighty torrent rushed up the beach, bringing with it driftwood\nand fish innumerable. It reached the new Holland, raised her up and\nwhirled her around and around like a top.\n\n"No use to use our power!" yelled Oscar, that George Dross might hear\nhim. "We are being carried further inland!"\n\nThe young captain was right, and now came a thump and a bump, as the\ncraft struck rocks and palm trees and then slid along a cliff. Oscar\nthought they might be carried directly to the center of the island, when\nof a sudden the tide turned and rolled back to the vast ocean. And they\nwent with it!\n\nBut those inside of the Holland XI. knew little now of where they were.\nHaving gotten into deep water, the force of the tidal wave turned the\ncraft completely over, and all those inside had all they could do to\nkeep themselves from being smashed to death on walls or ceiling.\n\nBut in less than three minutes the agitation was over and the new\nHolland righted herself. The water had come in at the broken window and\nthis had to be pumped out with all rapidity. Had not one of the men\nplaced a temporary plate over the window when first ordered to do so,\nthe new Holland would surely have been ',
    'swamped.\n\nInside of half an hour the tidal disturbances were at an end and the\nocean rolled as peacefully as before. Feeling they could now rise in\nsafety, the young captain gave the necessary orders and they went up.\n\nThe first sight which met their gaze filled them with wonder. All three\nof the foreign warships had been caught by the tidal wave and carried on\nthe rocks, and there they lay, battered and broken almost beyond\nrecognition.\n\nSailors and soldiers lay in the wreckage or floating helpless on the\ntide.\n\nA few had gone ashore, but these the Hawaiians had either shot down or\nmade prisoners.\n\n"Our work here is done," said Oscar. "Let us go back to Honolulu and see\nwhat damage has been done there."\n\nHis orders were obeyed and at Honolulu they found much of the shipping a\nwreck, yet but few lives had been lost.\n\nThe loss of the foreign ships was hailed with great delight and Oscar\nand his crew were entertained in fine style for the remainder of that\nday and also the next.\n\nIn the meantime the Holland XI. was repaired, making her once more as\ngood as new.\n\nEverybody wondered what had become of the balance of the foreign fleet\nwhich had set sail for San Francisco from Asiatic waters.\n\n"They must be somewhere in these waters," said Andy.\n\n"Perhaps they have pushed on to the United States," answered Captain\nOscar.\n\nThe young commander of the submarine craft was right.\n\nThirty-two of the foreign warships had pushed on, and word to this\neffect was brought to Honolulu the next day by a steamship which had run\naway from them by sheer good luck.\n\n"That ends our stay here," said Oscar.\n\nAnd within the hour the new Holland left the Hawaiian Islands behind,\nthe people of Honolulu cheering lustily as the craft left the harbor.\n\nThe air was all that could be desired and the run toward the Golden Gate\nwas made for days without anything of special interest happening.\n\nSometimes they put out a small drag net in which they caught many fish,\nwhich, properly cooked, were no mean ',
    'addition to their table.\n\n"If the weather holds out, we\'ll be in sight of California in two days,"\nobserved Oscar, one evening.\n\n"And I\'ll be glad of it," returned Andy. "I\'ll tell you what, there is\nnothing like the old States, after all!"\n\n"Right you are, Andy!"\n\nThe night was a hot one, and to get air, the new Holland came to the\nsurface and the trap-door of the deck was left wide open.\n\nOscar went to bed early and had been asleep less than an hour when a\nstrange rocking motion of the submarine awoke him.\n\n"Hullo, something is wrong!" he cried, and slipped into his clothing.\nThe rocking motion continued and he heard cries from several of his\ncrew.\n\n"We have sailed into a school of whales!" announced Andy, coming to him.\n\n"A school of whales!"\n\n"Exactly. They are around us as thick as bees around a pot of honey.\nJust look!"\n\nOscar ran to one of the windows and gazed out.\n\nHis chum was right. Whales were on every hand, so thick that the\nsubmarine boat could scarcely move among them.\n\n"This is the oddest yet!" was Oscar\'s comment. "We had better close the\ntrap-door and go down, before a whale gets into the screw and disables\nit."\n\nHe had just given the order to close the trap when there came a great\nshock from above, followed by a dripping of water.\n\nOne of the more sportive whales had thrown himself into the air,\nintending to come down on the Holland XI. and crush it.\n\n------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nTHE WHALE INTENDED TO CRUSH THE BOAT.\n\n------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nThe whale had struck the trap-door opening head first, and now his head\nwas as tight as if in a bear trap, sticking six feet and more down the\nnarrow companionway, leaving his mighty tail to flop above, high in the\nair!\n\nCHAPTER XVI.\n\nSAVING THE MERCHANTMAN.\n\n"Held—with a whale in us for a mast!" roared old George Dross. "Hang me,\nef this isn\'t the wust yet!"\n\n"We must get rid of that whale!" cried Captain Oscar. "If we ',
    'don\'t he\nmay turn the Holland over, with that trap-door open!"\n\n"All hands get something and shove him back!" put in Andy Greggs.\n\n"We can\'t do it," answered Oscar. "Hold, I have it!"\n\nWith all speed he ran to the ammunition room and soon returned with a\nsmall shell, of the kind usually used for signaling purposes.\n\nThis he rammed into the mouth of the whale, while the huge creature\nstrained and puffed and turned, rocking the new Holland violently.\n\n"Run away!" he cried, and set fire to the fuse of the shell.\n\nAll got out of sight as speedily as possible, and then waited.\n\nFifteen seconds passed and then the shell went off, with a muffled roar.\n\nThe head of the whale was torn to shreds, fat and blood spattering all\nsides of the companionway and the apartment around it.\n\nWith the head torn away, the body slid from the top of the Holland XI.\ninto the sea.\n\n"We are free!" gasped Andy, as soon as he could speak.\n\n"Shut the trap!" ordered Oscar, and it was done, old George Dross\ncleaning off the slide with a broom.\n\nThen the order came to sink the new Holland and they went down in the\nvery midst of the whales, who had parted for the instant after the\nexplosion and the sight of their headless companion.\n\n"That was an adventure I don\'t care to repeat," remarked Oscar, when all\ndanger was passed. "Who would have thought of a whale trying to get into\nthe Holland XI.?"\n\n"Reckon he knew a good thing when he saw it," grinned Andy.\n\nIt took quite some work to clean up the mess and there was little sleep\nfor anybody for the balance of that night.\n\nThe next day came a thunder storm.\n\nThe lightning was terrific and when the Holland XI. came up for some\nfresh air it seemed to play all around the steel plates of the submarine\nship.\n\nOne of the men went on deck and was hurled backward by the shock, with\nsuch force that he died an hour later, having had his skull fractured.\n\nThis was the first death which had occurred on board of the new Holland,\nand it cast a gloom over everybody.\n\nThe ',
    'trap was closed and the vessel sunk thirty feet below the surface.\n\nHere all was silent, for the heavy storm above could not reach them at\nsuch a depth.\n\nThe body of the dead man was placed in a canvas shroud and consigned to\nthe ocean, Oscar reading a chapter from the Bible and making a brief\naddress and prayer.\n\nThen they resumed the course eastward.\n\nTwenty-four hours later the storm had passed away and the lookout\nannounced several steamships in sight.\n\nAs they came closer they made out an American steamship loaded with\nmerchandise for the Philippines.\n\nThe merchantman was being chased by two Japanese warships.\n\nThe warships had already sent a ball through the merchantman\'s upper\nworks, but the latter still held to her course.\n\nThose on board knew that it was to them a matter of life or death.\n\nShould they surrender to the enemy they would most likely all be\nbutchered on the spot.\n\n"Here is work for us!" said Oscar, after surveying the chase through his\nglass. "We must get after those foreigners at once."\n\nDown went the Holland XI. to a distance of fifteen feet.\n\nThen a course was laid straight for the nearest of the Japanese\nwarships.\n\nThe crafts soon came together and a torpedo was fastened to the enemy\nclose to the stern.\n\nThen the new Holland sped off to where the second Japanese warship was\ncoming on.\n\nThose on the first ship were in the act of planting a broadside into the\nmerchantman when there came a rumble and a roar from the ocean, and the\nship sailed skyward, blown up as the Holland XI. had already blown up so\nmany others.\n\nIt was a frightful spectacle, that lurid flash, that thunderous report,\nand then the wreckage sailing in all directions and commingled with the\ntorn and mutilated bodies of the Japanese sailors and officers.\n\nThe sight held those on the merchantman spell-bound.\n\n"She has blown up her magazines!" was the cry. "Heaven be praised that\nit is so!"\n\nThen all attention was placed on the second Japanese warship, which was\nby far the ',
    'larger of the two.\n\nShe was coming on swiftly, but now she turned and fled, all on board\nfilled with terror.\n\n"We are saved!" cried those on the merchantman.\n\nAll were filled with wonder. Nobody could understand what had caused so\nspeedy a turn of the dire situation.\n\nBut when the new Holland came up and Captain Oscar showed himself with\nan American flag in his hand a mighty cheer went up.\n\n"It is the Holland XI.!"\n\n"Three cheers for the boat and the men that saved us!"\n\nOf course Captain Oscar was invited on board of the merchantman, and he\nwent, accompanied by Andy and George Dross.\n\nAll crowded around the young commander to learn how the destruction of\nthe Japanese vessel had been accomplished.\n\nFrom those on the merchantman Oscar learned that over thirty of the\nforeign warships had been seen off the Golden Gate, and that San\nFrancisco and Oakland were expecting a bombardment to begin at any\nmoment.\n\n"If that\'s the case we have no right to delay here," said the young\ncaptain.\n\nSoon the Holland XI. was again speeding eastward.\n\nA sharp lookout was kept for the foreign ships.\n\nThat evening they came upon half a dozen, riding close together.\n\nSmall boats were passing from one warship to another, as if an active\nconsultation of some sort was going on.\n\n"They are plotting something special, and I know it," said Oscar to\nAndy.\n\n"What could they plot—the bombardment of San Francisco?"\n\n"Perhaps worse. I wish I could find out."\n\nNo sooner had the thought entered the young captain\'s head than he\nresolved to act upon it.\n\nHe would come up directly in the rear of one of the ships and try to go\naboard in the dark.\n\nIt was a risky thing to do, but Oscar was far from being a coward.\n\nIndeed, nobody in the whole navy was more daring than this young\ninventor.\n\nThe ships comprised two Chinese cruisers, two Japanese cruisers and two\nEnglish men-of-war.\n\nThe conference was being held on board one of the British ships.\n\nAs silently as a shadow the new Holland glided along under the ',
    'Pacific\nOcean until directly under the stern of the British ship, which was\nnamed the Corcoran.\n\nAll was dark here, for the lights from the deck could not reach the\nspot.\n\nWith caution the trap-door of the Holland was opened.\n\nOscar came up and saw a large port open in the Corcoran to admit the\nevening breeze.\n\nHe climbed to this and saw that the apartment beyond was empty.\n\nFrom a distance came a murmur of voices and from overhead the steady\ntramping of feet.\n\n"Remain here for me," he said to Andy, who was on the deck. "Be prepared\nto let the Holland XI. down the instant I come on board again."\n\nThen the young captain passed into the Corcoran and out of sight of his\ncompanions.\n\nCHAPTER XVII.\n\nPLAYING THE SPY.\n\nCaptain Oscar Pelham knew only too well that he carried his life in his\nhands.\n\nHe was in the heart of the enemy\'s domain, and they would not hesitate\nto kill him on sight.\n\nHe must be cautions, for the ship was a strange one to him and it would\nbe easy to make a false move and thus expose himself.\n\nIn one hand he carried a long knife and in his belt rested a brace of\npistols.\n\nHe walked silently to the end of the stateroom he had entered, and\nthrough a half-open door saw a narrow passageway leading into a large\nand well-furnished cabin.\n\nFrom this cabin came the murmur of voices which had first greeted his\nears.\n\nThe British commander of the ship was holding a conference with the two\nChinese captains of the warships lying close alongside.\n\nAs Oscar took a step forward, a negro suddenly appeared, from another\nstateroom.\n\n"Hi, you——" began the negro, when Oscar caught him by the throat.\n\n"Silence! if you value your life!" muttered the young captain of the new\nHolland. "Say another word and I will kill you!"\n\nThe negro was powerful, and instead of keeping silent he tried to throw\nOscar off. Both went down to the floor and the negro strove to cry out.\n\nIt was a fatal move.\n\nDown came the keen knife, straight into the negro\'s body, and he lay\nstill where he had ',
    'fallen.\n\nOscar withdrew the bloody blade with a shudder.\n\nHe hated to take human life thus, but it had been rendered absolutely\nnecessary.\n\nHe stowed the body under a bunk and threw a blanket before it.\n\nThen wiping the knife on a curtain, he tiptoed his way closer to the\ncabin.\n\n"I do not see how your plan can succeed," he heard the English captain\nsay.\n\n"But it will succeed," replied one of the Chinese captains, with a\nstrong accent. "Chan Lee and I have it well in hand."\n\n"Then you must have a strong hold upon President Adams."\n\n"We have."\n\n"I doubt if he will agree, even so. Why, sir, if he did that, he would\nbe a traitor to his country—a regular Benedict Arnold."\n\nAt this both Chinese captains shrugged their bony shoulders and drew\ndown their almond-shaped eyes.\n\n"That is nothing to us," remarked the captain, who had heretofore\nremained silent.\n\n"He won\'t do it, I tell you."\n\n"Captain Gresson forgets that the President has lost his daughter," went\non the other Chinese captain.\n\n"Ha! So that is the way the wind blows!" ejaculated Captain Gresson.\n\n"You are now on the right path."\n\n"The girl was abducted."\n\nThe two Chinese captains bowed.\n\n"You have her on board of your ship?"\n\n"No, she is many miles from here."\n\n"Where?"\n\nAgain the two Chinese captains shrugged their shoulders.\n\n"Let us talk of something else," said one.\n\n"It is a clever plan, but a horrible one in the bargain," was the honest\ncomment of the British captain. "We don\'t make war in that fashion."\n\n"The Chinese fight as pleases them," answered one of the yellow\ncommanders.\n\n"Yes, I know. But I don\'t think you will succeed, anyway."\n\n"Why?"\n\n"President Adams would rather see his child killed before his face than\nprove a traitor to his country. I know these Americans."\n\n"Good for the Briton!" muttered Oscar. "His heart is in the right place,\neven if he is an enemy."\n\n"We shall see!" muttered one of the yellow captains. "But what of this\nattack on San Francisco?"\n\n"Orders are to commence at sunrise ',
    'to-morrow."\n\n"And how many ships will take part?"\n\n"Seven."\n\n"But seven?"\n\n"Yes."\n\n"And the remainder?"\n\n"The remainder will sail up the coast under the direction of the Russian\nadmiral."\n\n"To bombard the Alaskan coast and try to retake the territory," said the\nChinese captain, with a shrewd laugh. "The great Russian bear has always\nwanted Alaska back, since gold was discovered at the Klondyke and\nelsewhere."\n\n"Well, who can blame him?" answered the English captain. "What do you\nask at the hands of President Adams—a slice of California, where you can\nlocate a new Chinatown—and if he won\'t give it to you you will kill his\ndaughter."\n\nThe talk continued for several minutes more, when there came a call from\nthe deck.\n\n"I will come in a moment," said the English captain, and arising he\nhurried to the passageway in which Oscar was hiding.\n\nThe Englishman passed him, but not so the yellow captains.\n\nOne stumbled over a rug and pitched forward, clutching at the curtains\nwhich concealed Oscar.\n\nDown came the curtains.\n\n"Walila! Cher walila!" roared the second yellow captain. "A spy! He must\nbe killed!"\n\n"A spy!" cried the British captain.\n\n"Ha! You are a stranger to us!" came from Captain Gresson, and he eyed\nOscar sharply.\n\n"Hush! Not so loud!" said Oscar, and raised his hand, warningly.\n\nHe saw that he was in a bad situation—that nothing but a clever ruse\ncould save his life.\n\n"Why be still, young sir?" demanded the British captain, but in a lower\ntone.\n\n"We may be overheard," whispered Oscar. "I come to you on a secret\nerrand. Is the admiral on board?"\n\n"No, the admiral was here, but left an hour ago."\n\n"To go up the Alaskan coast?"\n\n"I believe so. But what is that to you? Who are you?"\n\n"I am Barton Peeks," answered Oscar.\n\nHe mentioned the name of a notorious British spy who had been captured\nin St. Louis, shortly after the great war broke out.\n\n"Barton Peeks!" ejaculated Captain Gresson. "Where have you been? How\ndid you get here?"\n\n"It is a long story, captain," replied ',
    'Oscar. "I was placed under arrest\nby those clever Yankees, but I found a friend and escaped one dark night\nin a heavy storm. But I have important news for the admiral. If he goes\nto the Alaskan coast all is lost."\n\n"Then you thought he was on board this vessel?"\n\n"I did; otherwise I would never have come on board."\n\n"How did you get here?"\n\n"In a submarine boat captured from the Yankees."\n\n"Not the Holland XI.?"\n\n"No, but a craft very much like her. We captured her while she was\ncoming through the Central American Canal. Six of the men on board were\nkilled. The engineer took the oath of allegiance to England and I got\naboard a new crew of men I could trust. We shall now be able to give the\nYankees a dose of our own medicine, captain."\n\n"It is a strange story, Peeks—a strange tale, truly. But you were always\na wizard, by the war reports—captured to-day and free to-morrow. Where\nis your craft?"\n\n"At the stern. Will you come on board?"\n\n"I am needed on deck now."\n\n"I will go aboard and wait for you, for I want you to help me.\nEverything is going wrong, and this movement on Alaska is the worst of\nall."\n\n"I would like to see that strange under-water ship," spoke up one of the\nyellow captains, who had listened to the talk with interest.\n\n"Then come with me," said Oscar, grimly. "And you\'ll be a prisoner in\nfive minutes more," he added under his breath.\n\nThe turn of affairs delighted him, for the Chinese commander was the\nsame who had spoken about President Adams\' daughter. Once he was a\nprisoner, Oscar was certain he could wring the yellow wretch\'s secret\nfrom him.\n\n"Remain here for a moment," said Oscar, as they neared the stern. "My\nmen are on guard and may not like to see me with a stranger, after my\ntelling them I had come on a secret mission. I will be back in a\nminute."\n\nThe Chinese captain agreed to wait, and Oscar hurried to the rear rail\nof the Corcoran.\n\nHe leaned far over, expecting to catch a dim view of the new Holland\nunderneath.\n\nThen a cry of dismay burst ',
    'from his lips.\n\nThe submarine craft was gone!\n\nCHAPTER XVIII.\n\nTHE CAPTURE OF HANG CHANG.\n\n"Gone!"\n\nSuch was the single word which escaped from Captain Oscar Pelham\'s lips\nas he gazed over the stern of the British warship into the darkness of\nthe Pacific Ocean.\n\nIn vain he scanned the waves, to the rear, to the larboard and\nstarboard. It was all to no purpose; the submarine craft had vanished\nutterly.\n\nWhat had become of her? Had those on board become scared and deserted\nhim?\n\nThe thought was agony. Andy and old George Dross deserting him? Never!\n\nAnd yet, why had they gone? Was it possible that men from other warships\nhad come up and captured his beloved ship and made prisoners of all on\nboard.\n\nHe looked back of him, and saw Hang Chang, the Chinese captain who had\nexpected to inspect the Holland, coming slowly toward him.\n\n"Is something wrong?" questioned the Celestial.\n\n"The boat—it must have sunk," said Oscar. He knew not what to say.\n\nAt this the second yellow commander plucked his companion by the sleeve.\n\n"Perhaps he has no boat," he whispered in Chinese. "It may be a ruse. He\nmay have been deceiving Captain Gresson."\n\nAt this Hang Chang shrugged his bony shoulders.\n\n"It may be so. Yet the English captain must know him, or all would not\nhave gone so smoothly in the cabin."\n\nIn the meantime, Oscar was straining his eyes as never before, in his\nsearch for the Holland.\n\nWhat was that? A tiny ray of light, shooting up from the dark green\ndepths of the ocean. It was the Holland XI., moving silently and slowly\nto her old position under the stern. Soon she came up and the trap-door\nopened noiselessly.\n\n"My vessel is back, sir," announced Oscar, with a bow. "If it will\nplease your highness to visit my filthy quarters I will do what I can to\nmake his visit full of pleasure."\n\nHis form of address was in the regular Chinese style—for a Chinaman\nalways depreciates his own residence—and Hang Chang smiled broadly.\n\n"Thank you, I will go," he said, his suspicions ',
    'removed.\n\nOscar led the way and the Celestial followed. The second Chinaman held\nback.\n\n"Have a care!" he called out in Chinese.\n\nBy this time Oscar and Hang Chang were on the deck of the new Holland.\nAndy was looking up the companionway filled with wonder.\n\n"Sixteen, nine," said Oscar, to his lieutenant.\n\nDuring their spare time Oscar had formulated a secret language and had\ntaught it to all on board of the Holland XI.\n\nEach number meant something important.\n\nSixteen meant, "There is an enemy here." Nine meant, "Go down as quickly\nas possible."\n\nAndy understood and passed the word along.\n\nOscar was on the companionway and Hang Chang was following him, when all\nof a sudden an alarm arose on board of the Corcoran.\n\nThe body of the negro had been discovered and all was confusion.\n\n"A murder!" shrieked the second yellow captain. "I knew something was\nwrong. Hang Chang, come back!"\n\nSoon faces appeared at the stern of the Corcoran, and a pistol was\nleveled at those below.\n\n"Come back here!"\n\n"I—I will go back," stammered Hang Chang, in alarm.\n\n"Not much!" retorted Oscar, and seizing the Celestial by the foot he\ngave a jerk, which landed Hang Chang flat on his back at the bottom of\nthe companionway.\n\n"Down, quick!" cried the young captain, and in a trice the trap in the\ndeck was closed and the Holland XI. began to sink.\n\nThey were not an instant too soon, for just as the waters of the Pacific\nclosed over the craft a gun was trained on her from one of the Chinese\nwarships.\n\nBang! and the ball grazed the upper plates of the submarine boat.\n\nBut before another shot could be fired the new Holland was safe, having\nslid under the Corcoran and away out of sight and hearing.\n\nWhile this was going on Oscar had thrown himself on Hang Chang.\n\nThe Chinese captain was a powerful man and realizing that he had been\ncaught in a trap he resolved to sell his life as dearly as possible.\n\nHe was on the floor, but soon he struggled to his knees and tried to\nthrow Oscar.\n\nOver and over went the pair, ',
    'bumping against the companionway ladder and\nthe hard steel walls of the ship. Then the Chinaman grabbed Oscar by the\nthroat.\n\n"Die, dog!" he hissed in his native tongue. "If I have to go, you shall\ngo with me!"\n\nAll was becoming black before Oscar\'s eyes. He tried to get his\nbreath—to cry out. All in vain.\n\nThe young captain felt his senses leaving him, when somebody rushed up.\nIt was Andy, who had left the spot to give directions to the engineer.\n\nWithout hesitation Andy leaped at Hang Chang.\n\nOne heavy blow behind the ear staggered the Chinaman and another under\nthe jaw made him relax his hold and stagger to the lower step of the\nladder.\n\nThen Oscar recovered sufficiently to add another blow, on the nose,\nwhich drew blood and caused Hang Chang to become partly unconscious.\n\n"Bring the irons," said Oscar, to one of the ship\'s hands who was\npassing.\n\nThe irons were speedily brought, and by the time Hang Chang was himself\nagain he was bound, hands and feet, and chained to one of the walls of\nthe Holland XI.\n\nHe raved, swore and prayed to his gods for deliverance. He called Oscar\nall the vile names his tongue could frame, and finally fell in a fit\nfrom which he did not recover for hours.\n\n"I tricked him nicely," said the young captain, with a grim smile.\n\n"But what made you bring him on board?" asked Andy.\n\n"He holds an important secret. He knows all about the abduction of\nPresident Adams\' daughter."\n\n"Oh! Then you have made quite a haul."\n\n"Yes."\n\nThe appearance and disappearance of the new Holland had caused much\nconsternation on board of all the warships congregated outside of San\nFrancisco harbor.\n\nSeveral on board of the Corcoran had known the celebrated spy, Barton\nPeeks, and from these men the English captain gathered that he was an\nentirely different looking individual from Oscar.\n\n"We have been duped!" said Captain Gresson. "That rascal must have been\na Yankee."\n\n"Then his submarine boat must have been the Holland XI.," added his\nfirst officer.\n\nThe foreign ships ',
    'were very uneasy, yet just at present those on them\nhad nothing to fear.\n\nThe course of the new Holland was straight for San Francisco.\n\n"We must inform the naval authorities of what has been done at Honolulu,\nand of the expedition to Alaskan waters," said Oscar.\n\nThe new Holland arrived at San Francisco without anything unusual\nhappening, and here Oscar spent a full hour with his superiors.\n\nThe naval commander was well satisfied with the work at Hawaii, and\nastonished that the bombardment of the Golden Gate was to be little more\nthan a ruse.\n\n"We must send a strong fleet to Alaskan waters at once," he said. "And\nthe new Holland must go with our warships."\n\nTo hear was to obey, and soon Oscar had received his orders in full, and\nwas once more on board of his submarine craft.\n\nHe said nothing to the admiral about Hang Chang, wishing to discover for\nhimself what had become of Martha Adams.\n\nHe was not thinking of the one hundred thousand dollars reward offered\nfor her recovery.\n\nHe could think only of her beautiful form, her deep brown eyes and that\nsilvery voice which had so thrilled him in former days.\n\nHe knew that she was the President\'s daughter, and stood high in\nsociety. Yet he was a captain in the navy and the inventor of a boat\nwhich had performed wonders in this fearful war, and there was no\ntelling how high he might stand at the end of the contest.\n\nFrom the admiral he learned that the navy department contemplated the\nconstruction of three other vessels similar to the Holland XI.\n\nIf these were built, Oscar would be put in command of the submarine\nsquadron, with the rank of commodore.\n\nCHAPTER XIX.\n\nNEWS OF THE PRESIDENT\'S DAUGHTER.\n\n"Now where, Oscar?"\n\nIt was Andy who asked the question.\n\n"Back to those ships we left several hours ago."\n\n"Are we to blow them up?"\n\n"Blow up as many as we can."\n\n"And after that?"\n\n"We are off for the coast of Alaska."\n\n"Gee-rusalem! That\'s a long trip!"\n\n"So it is. But there may be lots of glory in it. And ',
    'Andy?"\n\n"Well."\n\n"You want to make a good record for yourself."\n\n"How so?"\n\n"The government is going to build three more ships like the Holland."\n\n"That means that they will want three more captains."\n\n"Exactly, Andy, and I intend to put in a good word for you," added\nOscar.\n\n"Thank you, Oscar, you always were the best chum in the world. But if I\nget one of those boats I\'ll hate to leave you."\n\n"I may become commodore of the squadron and if so I\'ll see that you are\nalways close to me."\n\nIt was now coming morning, and by the gray light of dawn they soon came\nupon the two Japanese and two Chinese ships getting ready to bombard San\nFrancisco and Oakland.\n\nThe Corcoran and her sister ship had disappeared.\n\n"I\'m not sorry about the Corcoran," mused Oscar. "Captain Gresson seemed\na pretty decent sort of fellow. I would hate to blow him up."\n\n"Suppose Martha Adams is on board one of those ships?" asked Andy.\n\nAt this remark the young captain could not help shuddering.\n\n"Don\'t! It makes me heartsick to think of it," he groaned.\n\n"Why don\'t you make Hang Chang talk?"\n\n"I will make him talk! I\'ll make him tell me everything!" cried Oscar,\nwith sudden determination.\n\nHe had tried to talk to the Chinaman before, but Hang Chang had refused\nto open his lips.\n\nThe Celestial was still chained to the wall. He sat on the floor, his\nknees drawn up to his chin, a sullen look on his thin, yellow face.\n\n"Hang Chang, I want to talk to you," began Oscar.\n\nTo this there was no answer. Indeed, the Celestial did not even lift his\neyes.\n\n"Do you hear? I want to talk to you. If you value your life you will\nspeak."\n\nAt this the Chinese captain shifted uneasily.\n\n"What does the Yankee wish me to say?" he asked, with a treacherous look\nfrom his almond-shaped eyes.\n\n"I want you to tell me the truth about President Adams\' daughter. Where\nis she?"\n\n"She is—safe."\n\n"You have her a prisoner."\n\n"How does the Yankee know that? Ha! You overheard my talk on the\nCorcoran."\n\n"I did. Where is she? I demand to know."\n\n"She ',
    'is, as I said before, safe." And the Celestial grinned wickedly.\n\n"Hang Chang, you are playing with fire. We Americans are civilized and\ndo not usually harm the prisoners we take. But unless you tell me what I\nwant to know it will go hard with you. Martha Adams is too good to\nremain a prisoner of the yellow dogs who are holding her."\n\n"There is an easy way for her to become free."\n\n"How?"\n\n"Let your President do as China demands and she shall be returned to her\nfather safe and sound."\n\n"You talk as the savage Indians of years ago used to talk. I demand to\nknow at once where she is."\n\n"I have nothing more to say."\n\n"Do you value your life? Would you not give something to be set again at\nliberty?"\n\n"No."\n\n"You tell a lie when you say that. You do value your life, and it would\nbe far sweeter for you to go free than to suffer the torture which\nawaits you if you refuse to speak."\n\n"Torture!"\n\n"Aye, torture; Hang Chang—torture worse than any you ever inflicted on\nJapanese or Tartar—a torture which will make you writhe and scream in\nspite of yourself."\n\nOscar had no intention of torturing the yellow wretch, but he spoke so\nearnestly that Hang Chang shivered and his yellow face blanched.\n\n"I thought the Yankees did not torture their prisoners," he faltered.\n\n"Usually they do not, but there are exceptions to all cases. I think\nmuch of Martha Adams, and am bound to restore her to her parents. If you\ndo not tell me where she is you shall suffer all the horrors of the Pit\nof Everlasting Fire! I will kill you by inches! You shall thirst, you\nshall starve, you shall burn, all at the same time. Now take your\nchoice."\n\n"I—I will say nothing," responded Hang Chang, but his lips trembled so\nthat he could scarcely frame the words.\n\nOscar turned to Andy, who had come up.\n\n"Lieutenant Greggs, see to it that the foot plates are made red-hot," he\nordered. "Perhaps he will talk after his feet have been well warmed."\n\n"No! no! Do not scorch my feet!" wailed the yellow wretch. "I ',
    'suffered\nthat once—from the Borneo pirates—I could not stand it again."\n\n"And, Lieutenant Greggs, see that the branding iron is also made\nred-hot," went on Oscar, calmly. "Hang Chang needs a mark of beauty upon\neach cheek and upon his chin."\n\n"No! no! no! I will not stand it! It is inhuman!" shrieked the\nCelestial. "Do not touch me! I—I will tell all I know, if only you will\nlet me go!" And he fell upon his bony knees in front of Oscar.\n\n"Then tell me at once where Martha Adams is. And mind I will not let you\ngo until you have proved your words true."\n\n"And if I tell you the truth will you let me go?" questioned Hang Chang,\neagerly.\n\n"Yes."\n\n"She is on board of our warship, the Green Dragon."\n\n"You are positive of this?"\n\n"I swear it!" And Hang Chang beat upon his forehead with his hand.\n\n"Where is the Green Dragon now?"\n\n"Many miles from here."\n\n"I asked where?"\n\n"I cannot tell exactly. She sailed from Chesapeake Bay southward to the\ncoast of Cuba."\n\n"Is she with other warships?"\n\n"No, she is alone, for with the President\'s daughter on board, it was\nthought best by our admiral not to let her go into any fights."\n\nAt this Oscar drew a long breath. At least for the present this lovely\ngirl was safe.\n\n"Have you informed President Adams that you are holding his daughter?"\n\n"Not yet, but we expect to do so soon."\n\n"And you intended to give her up only when he should grant what China\ndemanded?"\n\n"Yes."\n\n"What ships have you here?"\n\n"The Pekin and the Shanghai."\n\n"You are certain she is on board neither of these?"\n\n"She is thousands of miles from here, on the Green Dragon, as I swore\nbefore."\n\n"Very well, I will take your word for it. But if you have played me\nfalse let me say no torture I can think of shall be spared you."\n\n"I have told the simple truth. When will you let me go?"\n\n"As soon as I can prove your words. I have work ahead now, and when that\nis done I shall go in search of the Green Dragon."\n\n"And in the meantime?"\n\n"In the meantime you must remain on board of the ',
    'Holland. But you will\nfare as well as any of us."\n\n"Then you will unchain me?"\n\n"No, I cannot as yet trust you that far."\n\n"And when you have found the Green Dragon, what then?"\n\n"I will try to make terms with those on board."\n\n"What terms?" questioned Hang Chang, eagerly.\n\n"Wait and you will see," replied Oscar gravely.\n\nCHAPTER XX.\n\nTHE CAVE UNDER THE OCEAN.\n\nBy the time Oscar\'s interview with Hang Chang was over it was broad\ndaylight.\n\nThe two Japanese and two Chinese warships had drawn as closely as\npossible to San Francisco and Oakland, and now they began to bombard\nthose cities with all their power.\n\nShot and shell told heavily along the water front, but not one of either\nstruck into the heart of the cities, for the foreign guns could not\ncarry so far.\n\nThe guns of the forts in the harbor responded nobly and a well-directed\nfire soon put one of the Chinese cruisers, the Pekin, out of the race\nforever.\n\nThe Pekin was a sister ship to the Tien-Tsin, which the Holland had\nannihilated on her maiden trip at the opening of the great war.\n\nShe carried many guns and over eight hundred sailors and officers, and\nwas certainly a formidable fighting machine.\n\nThis was Hang Chang\'s vessel, but Oscar did not let his prisoner know of\nthis.\n\n"No use to make him feel worse than he does," said the young captain to\nhis lieutenant. "He may go and do something desperate. You know some\nChinese commit suicide after defeat."\n\n"But not Hang Chang," answered Andy. "He\'s too much of a coward."\n\nBoom! crash! came a rumble and a roar, and the Pekin was seen to be\nenveloped in a sheet of flame from end to end. She did not sink, and\nsoon her magazines caught fire, and then it was the old story over again\nof a cruiser blown into atoms.\n\nThe annihilation of the Pekin was speedily followed by the wrecking of\nthe first of the Japanese warships, which had the keel split into three\nparts. The Japanese could not understand what struck them and scores of\nthem leaped overboard, to be speedily pulled under ',
    'by the vast suction\nwhen the ship suddenly settled with a plunge, and went from sight\nforever.\n\nThe alarm was now great on board of the second Japanese warship, the\nTokio, for those on her had seen that something was around in the\nwater—a deadly enemy. The commander at once issued orders that the\nvessel withdraw from the fight and run from the vicinity.\n\nThis sudden withdrawal proved almost fatal for the Holland XI. without\nthe Japanese being aware of what they were doing. As the great warship\nmade a turn, one of her anchors slipped overboard, and the anchor chain\nbecame entangled in the screw of the submarine craft, hauling her around\nlike a flash.\n\n"Something is wrong with the screw!" announced George Dross to Oscar\nthrough the speaking tube.\n\n"Turn off the power."\n\n"I have already done so."\n\n"We are being dragged backward!" put in Andy, as he looked out of one of\nthe glass windows.\n\nThe young captain ran to the rear lookout and made an examination. He\nsaw the anchor chain and saw how the new Holland was being towed\nbackward by the cruiser overhead. Then the chain became tighter, as\nthose on board of the Tokio tried to recover the anchor which had\ndropped overboard.\n\nBut the power overhead was not equal to the task of bringing in the\nanchor with such a weight attached, and presently the task was abandoned\nfor the time being.\n\n"I reckon they are thinking only of escaping from the hidden monster\nthat blew up the other warships," said Captain Oscar, and in this\nsurmise he was correct.\n\nOn and on swept the Japanese cruiser, with steam at full power and every\nsail set. The wind was almost due north and the course of the vessel lay\nin that direction.\n\n"Where can she be going?" asked Andy.\n\n"Perhaps she is going to join that fleet in Alaskan waters."\n\n"By Jove! That\'s so, Oscar. Perhaps those English ships have gone to\njoin that fleet, too."\n\n"More than likely."\n\nA consultation was now held as to what could be done concerning the\nentangled screw.\n\nWith the Holland being ',
    'towed at such a speed it was impossible to go\noutside and untwist the anchor chain.\n\nAs the bow of the submarine craft was pointed away from the Tokio, it\nwas equally impossible to fire a torpedo at the Japanese vessel and thus\nblow her up.\n\n"Besides, if we did that," said Oscar, "some of the wreckage might cling\nfast to the other end of the anchor chain and drag us to the bottom of\nthe ocean."\n\nIt was a desperate situation, yet as hour after hour went by and nothing\nunusual happened, they became accustomed to it, and Andy even cracked a\njoke on the point.\n\n"We\'re getting a free tow," he said, with a grin. "Wonder if they won\'t\nbe sending in a bill to the Government for the job."\n\nThe course of the Tokio had been northward, but now the big cruiser\nturned almost due east.\n\n"She is running for Fisherman\'s Bay," said one of those on the Holland\nXI. who happened to know the California coast thoroughly.\n\n"Is it deep there?" asked Oscar.\n\nBefore the man could reply all on board of the submarine craft heard a\ngrating sound.\n\n"We are dragging on the bottom!" gasped Andy.\n\nOrders were passed to George Dross and the new Holland came up close to\nthe side of the Japanese warship.\n\nHad they remained longer under the big craft they might have been\ncrushed between the rocks on the bottom and the keel of the cruiser.\n\nPresently the big cruiser came to a standstill, and a minute later those\non board of the Holland XI. heard the roar of her mighty guns.\n\nThe Tokio had found a single American warship in the harbor and was\ndoing her best to sink the craft.\n\nThe warship was something of a transport and was carrying sixteen\nhundred soldiers to San Francisco, from Tacoma, Washington.\n\nShe had put into the bay for fresh water and was now doing her best to\nfight the Tokio off.\n\nBut it was an unequal struggle, for her guns were much smaller than\nthose on the Japanese vessel. Soon she had a gaping hole in her side,\nbut fortunately this was two feet above the water line.\n\nWhile the Tokio ',
    'continued to fire shot and shell, Oscar gave orders to\nGeorge Dross to bring the new Holland around under the warship\'s stern.\n\nThen the young captain put on a diving suit and ordered Andy to do the\nsame.\n\nBoth went forth and with caution made their way to the stern of the\nHolland XI.\n\nThe anchor chain was twisted twice around the screw and it took all\ntheir strength on a long crowbar to set the screw free.\n\nIt was dangerous work, for had they been caught in the chain when it\nslipped away, one or both would surely have been killed.\n\nIn a quarter of an hour they were back to the new Holland, but so\nexhausted that neither could stand upright.\n\n"Try the screw!" panted Oscar. "If it is all right, fix a torpedo under\nthe warship and run away."\n\nThe screw was tried immediately and found to work as well as ever.\n\nThen the torpedo was brought forth from the ammunition room and\nadjusted, and the Holland XI. ran off a distance of a quarter of a mile\nand then came to the surface.\n\nThe Tokio was preparing to close in on the American transport; with the\nevident intention of killing or capturing all on board, when the torpedo\nwent off with a rumble and a roar that could be heard for many miles\naround.\n\nThe execution done by the torpedo was frightful, for the instrument of\ndeath had been attached to the weakest part of the Japanese ship\'s keel.\n\nThe charge went straight up through the four decks of the Tokio, setting\nfire to every magazine.\n\nIt was a fireworks spectacle which could not be equaled and was followed\nby a scene of horror.\n\nEverything went to pieces at once, and it is safe to say that scarcely\nan officer or a man on board escaped with his life.\n\nThose on the American transport could scarcely believe their eyes, and\nwhen the Holland appeared and a man went to the deck, to wave an\nAmerican flag and then the private flag of the submarine craft, there\nwas a wild hurrahing.\n\n"The Holland XI.!"\n\n"What a wonderful boat!"\n\n"Three cheers for her and her gritty commander and ',
    'crew!"\n\nAnd the cheers were given with a will.\n\nThe captain of the transport wished to thank Oscar in person, but the\nmost the new Holland could do was to run alongside of the transport, and\nOscar merely showed himself.\n\n"We are off for Alaska," he said. "We are after the big Russian fleet."\n\n"Good!" was the answer. "Hope you do them all up!" And then another\ncheer went up.\n\nSoon the Holland was cutting the waters of the ocean at a speed of\ntwenty knots an hour.\n\nOscar felt pretty certain that the first attack of the Russian fleet\nwould be made at Cape Nome.\n\nIn 1900, Cape Nome had boasted of less than a thousand souls, now the\ncity contained over fifty thousand inhabitants.\n\nThe Cape Nome mines had proved richer than any mines ever discovered in\nCalifornia or Australia, and the city contained a government assay\noffice and several first-class banks.\n\nAt one of the banks was stored gold to the value of thirty-five millions\nof dollars, and silver to the value of eighteen millions of dollars.\n\n"The Russians have their eyes on that gold and silver," said Oscar. "And\nthey sha\'n\'t get it, not if I can prevent the move."\n\nDay after day the new Holland kept on her journey, only stopping once\nfor extra food and water.\n\nThen they ran between a number of islands, and one day found themselves\ncaught in a storm and entered a little cave under a cliff.\n\nThe storm increased in violence and the heavy rains caused a landslide.\n\nThere was a strange rumble over their heads and the water was boiling\nand foaming on all sides of the Holland.\n\n"By Jove! I don\'t like this!" cried Andy. "Something is wrong."\n\n"It sounds like an earthquake," replied Oscar. "And see how dark it is\ngetting."\n\nThe young captain of the Holland was right; the light of day had\nsuddenly ceased to shine in on them and nothing more could be seen until\nthe electric lights were lit.\n\n"We had better move out of here," said George Dross.\n\n"Right you are," said Oscar, "and the sooner the better. That cliff may\nbe coming down on ',
    'our heads."\n\nThe order was given to go forward, but the new Holland had run less than\na hundred feet when she came to a sudden stop.\n\nRocks blocked her way on every side.\n\nThen the submarine craft began to back, but soon other rocks brought her\nto a standstill.\n\nThe terrible truth burst upon those on board.\n\nThey were prisoners in the cave under the ocean!\n\nCHAPTER XXI.\n\nOUT OF ONE DANGER INTO ANOTHER.\n\nEntombed alive!\n\nSuch was the agonizing thought which came to the mind of everybody on\nboard of the Holland XI.\n\nThe submarine craft was caught in the cave under the ocean, and there\nseemed no way of escape.\n\nThe darkness outside was intense, and the water still boiled and foamed\nupon every side.\n\nOnce a huge rock came squarely down upon the upper side of the new\nHolland with a shock that made those inside fear the craft would be\nsmashed flat.\n\nBut at last all became quiet as a tomb.\n\nThe searchlight was brought into play and they looked eagerly for some\nway out of the cave.\n\nBut rear and front entrances were blocked by rocks almost as large as\nthe Holland herself and could not be budged.\n\nAn hour passed—a time full of awful anxiety.\n\nWhat if the whole top of the sea-cave should give way?\n\nIt would prove the end of the new Holland and all on board!\n\n"We must do something," said Oscar. "I am going outside.\n\n"You may be killed," said Andy.\n\n"And I may be killed staying here."\n\n"If you go I shall go with you," returned the lieutenant.\n\nTogether the chums put on diving suits.\n\nThen the torpedo trap was opened and they glided out on the bottom of\nthe sea-cave.\n\nIt was of sand, with sharp rocks scattered here and there.\n\nOscar took with him a powerful electric hand light, and also a small\ndynamite shell.\n\nThe pair walked to the front end of the cave and made a thorough\nexamination of the rocks.\n\n"No way out of here," muttered Oscar, and then shook his head at Andy,\nwho also replied in the negative.\n\nThe next movement was toward the rear end of the cave.\n\nThey had just ',
    'passed the stern of the Holland XI. when Oscar grabbed\nAndy by the arm and pointed ahead.\n\nA huge mound of sand was moving, as if it were alive!\n\nWith anxious eyes they gazed on the sand pile, until of a sudden it was\nscattered in all directions and from underneath a huge sea serpent\nshowed itself.\n\nThe monster was all of thirty feet long and as thick around as a\ngood-sized stovepipe.\n\nIt had a broad, flat head, from out of which shone two hideous eyes of\nbright yellow.\n\nIts color was green and white, and its tail was shaped like that of a\nfish.\n\nIn a twinkle it curled itself into a number of loops and raised its\nslimy head.\n\nThose piercing eyes were turned first upon Andy and then upon Oscar.\n\nThey moved from one to the other with the steadiness of a clock\npendulum, and each young man was fairly fascinated.\n\nAndy tried to move, but found himself rooted to the spot, for those\nyellow eyes had burnt themselves into his very brain.\n\nOscar, too, was almost transfixed.\n\nThen slowly, but surely, the huge serpent moved closer to the two,\nintending to embrace the pair as one and crush them.\n\nBut the movement broke the spell so far as Oscar was concerned, and\nhardly knowing what he was doing the young captain hurled the dynamite\nshell at the water reptile.\n\nIt struck the serpent on the head, and with a strange hiss the monster\nset its teeth into the shell.\n\nOscar was pulling Andy with him.\n\nThere was a dull explosion, and the water was filled with bits of the\nserpent\'s head and neck and also with the sand which was stirred up.\n\nWhen Oscar got up again he found the serpent\'s harmless body whipping\nitself furiously against the rocks.\n\nAndy was so weak he could hardly stand, and Oscar had to support him\nback to the submarine craft.\n\nAll on board shivered when they heard of the sea serpent, and by turning\nthe searchlight in that direction they saw the body still coiling and\nuncoiling on the sand.\n\n"I wouldn\'t go out there for a million dollars," said Marney, the air\nman.\n\n"Nor I," ',
    'said Walton, the fellow in charge of the ammunition room.\n\n"Well, I\'m going out again," said Oscar. "But this time I shall go armed\nwith a rifle as well as with the dynamite."\n\nThe new Holland boasted of several electric rifles, which could readily\nbe discharged under water.\n\n"I\'ll go along in place of Andy, if you\'ll have me," said old George\nDross.\n\n"All right," said Oscar.\n\nThe pair were soon outside, each with a rifle and each carrying a\ndynamite bomb.\n\nThey made a thorough examination of the cave and during that time\nnothing but a few curious, but harmless, fish came to disturb them.\n\nAt one point they discovered a small opening through which came a faint\nlight.\n\nSome small rocks were in the way and these pulled aside they saw that\nonly one large stone lay between them and the outside ocean.\n\nOscar pointed to the rock and to his dynamite shell and George Dross\nnodded, to show that he understood.\n\nThe two shells which they carried were placed in proper position and\nthey hurried back to the Holland.\n\nThey had scarcely re-entered the submarine craft when the dynamite\nshells went off.\n\nThe water was filled with the shattered rocks and as these cleared away\nthey saw a good-sized opening ahead.\n\n"Hurrah, for our imprisonment is at an end!" cried Andy.\n\nThe new Holland was sent forward at full speed through the opening, and\nonce she was free those on board lost no time in quitting the vicinity\nof the islands.\n\n"No more ocean cave for me," said Oscar. "One such experience is enough\nfor me."\n\n"And that serpent!" said Andy, with a shudder. "I imagine I\'ll dream of\nhim for many a night to come." And he did, getting such a nightmare that\nOscar often had to wake him up.\n\nFour days later they came up to a point within twenty-two miles of Cape\nNome.\n\nThe weather was now fine and a constant lookout was kept for foreign\nships.\n\nOnce they passed an American warship bound for Seattle, and hailed her\nfor news.\n\nThe Americans knew nothing about the Russian fleet, but said the ',
    'people\nat Cape Nome were daily in fear of attack.\n\n"Well, I can\'t say that I blame them," said Oscar. "That gold must be a\ngreat temptation."\n\n"Right you are," returned Andy.\n\nFor several hours the sky had been overcast, showing that a heavy storm\nwas at hand.\n\nIt was so hot on board of the Holland XI. that the young captain hated\nto order the submarine craft below the surface of the ocean.\n\n"I don\'t believe that storm can do us much damage," he said.\n\n"Unless we get struck by the lightning," replied Andy.\n\nPresently it began to rain, but this did not matter, for what little\nwater came into the new Holland ran into the well and was promptly\npumped out by the electric pump.\n\nOscar was tired, for he had been working hard for several hours, helping\nto repair some wires which had broken.\n\nHe laid down to rest, and was just in a doze when a report like a cannon\nclose to his ears almost stunned him.\n\nThe air was full of electricity, and as soon as he recovered he realized\nthat what Andy had mentioned had happened. The Holland XI. had been\nstruck by lightning.\n\nStaggering to his feet he made his way toward the engine room.\n\nHe had scarcely entered the compartment when he stumbled over the body\nof George Dross.\n\n"Dross!" he murmured. "Are you dead?"\n\nNo reply came back and the engineer lay like a log where he had fallen.\n\nOscar had scarcely made his unwelcome discovery when he noticed that\nsomething was wrong with the engines of the new Holland.\n\nThe submarine craft was running at a furious rate of speed, the\nindicator showing several points beyond the danger limit.\n\n"My graciolus! This won\'t do!" he ejaculated, and leaped to the\ncontrolling lever.\n\nAs his hand touched the lever a spark of fire flew from the end of it to\na wheel close at hand.\n\nOscar received a shock, but not such a one as he would have gotten had\nhis hand remained on the bar of steel.\n\n"Oh!" he gasped. "That was a close shave. I might have been\nelectrocuted!"\n\nBy this time he heard Andy calling to him.\n\n"Here I ',
    'am, in the engine room," he called back.\n\n"Stop the boat! We are shipping water fast!" came from Andy.\n\n"I can\'t stop her!" replied Oscar. "Shut the trap-door at once."\n\nWithout delay Andy tried to follow out the order given.\n\nNo sooner had he touched the steel plate than he gave a gasp and fell\ndown the companionway and lay like one dead.\n\nThe fall reached Oscar\'s ears and he came out to see what was the\nmatter.\n\nThen the terrible truth burst upon him.\n\nThe bolt of lightning had disarranged the electric machinery on board of\nthe Holland XI. and the submarine craft was now at the mercy of the\npowerful current which seemed to be beyond control.\n\nCHAPTER XXII.\n\nA RUN NOT WANTED.\n\n"Andy! Andy! Rise up!" cried Oscar, with increasing horror. "Tell me\nthat you are not dead!"\n\nBut Andy did not budge, nor did even a groan escape his lips.\n\n"If he is dead, and George Dross, what will I do?" thought the young\nnaval captain.\n\nNever had his heart so failed him as now. He was still weak from the\nshock, and to think that his two best friends might be lost to him\nforever was sufficient to make him collapse utterly.\n\nThe electricity was now playing around every part of the engine room,\ncausing little flashes of fire and numerous sparks to fly hither and\nthither. It was a pretty sight, but woe to him who should come within\nthe influence of that display!\n\nOscar dragged George Dross\' body into another compartment, and as he did\nso one of the other hands appeared.\n\n"Captain," he cried, hoarsely, "we are running too fast!"\n\n"I know it, but I cannot help it."\n\n"The trap——"\n\n"Don\'t touch the trap."\n\n"But the water——"\n\n"The lightning has played the old Harry with our engine. Everything is\ncharged with electricity. He tried to close the trap, and look at him."\n\nOscar pointed to Andy and the man gave a start of horror. Then he stared\nat the body of Dross.\n\n"Is he dead, too?"\n\n"I trust not, but I am by no means sure, Gilson."\n\n"But what shall we do, captain? I reckon all of the others are ',
    'either\nstunned or dead."\n\n"The lookout, what of him?" demanded Oscar, quickly.\n\n"On the floor in a heap."\n\n"Too bad! We might run into something, and then——"\n\nOscar did not finish, but Gilson, who was a general all-around helper on\nthe submarine craft, understood what was in his mind.\n\n"We\'ll go to smash, eh?"\n\n"Yes, Gilson. But be careful what you try to do."\n\n"Can\'t we turn the electricity off?"\n\n"We can if the switch is all right."\n\nIt may be mentioned here that all on board wore rubber shoes, so that no\nelectricity might ever shock them through the feet while walking in\ndangerous places.\n\nTogether the young captain and Gilson hurried to where the switchboard\nwas located, between the engine room and the tiny compartment built for\nthe lookout.\n\n"Ginger!" came from Gilson. "Burnt out! That was a strong stroke of\nlightning, and no mistake!"\n\nGilson was right. The switchboard was completely wrecked and lay in a\nblack mass on the floor. It had been burning, but the fire was now out,\nfor it could not communicate with the steel plates of the new Holland.\n\n"Now what\'s to do, captain? How are you going to control that current?"\n\nThe question was one not easy to answer.\n\n"I\'ll have to make a thorough examination first," replied Oscar. "In the\nmeantime you attend to the others and see if some of them at least are\nnot alive."\n\n"Lieutenant Greggs don\'t look much alive," said Gilson. "Nor does George\nDross. But I\'ll do what I can for all hands."\n\nLeft to himself, Oscar made the entire rounds of the submarine craft,\nsurveying all of the intricate electric machinery with care.\n\n"It\'s a wonder the lightning didn\'t set off some of the torpedoes or\ndynamite bombs," he said to himself. "If they had gone off we would have\nbeen blown to kingdom come."\n\nThe result of the examination was far from satisfactory. Many of the\nelectric wires on board had become badly "crossed," and a new machine,\ncalled an electrogratrode, used for regulating the current, was running\nin a manner that completely ',
    'puzzled the young inventor.\n\n"This is a brand new experience, that\'s sure," he told himself. "If I\never get out of this alive I\'ll beware of thunderstorms in the future."\n\nThe new Holland continued to dash along over the surface of the water\nand at every big wave a large quantity of water came pouring down the\ncompanionway, until the well-hole was full and overflowing in spite of\nthe fact that the pumping engine was working faster than ever before.\n\n"Something has got to be done," muttered Oscar, with set teeth. "If that\nwater gets too high it will carry the electricity everywhere and we\'ll\nbe killed on the spot."\n\nGetting out a long hook covered with rubber he began to work on the\nplate of the trap-door.\n\nFor some time he could not budge it and more than once a slight shock of\nelectricity made him halt. But at last the trap shut with a click.\n\n"Shut," he muttered, and then came a thought that made him turn pale.\nHad he locked himself and the others in what would prove their tomb of\nsteel?\n\nThe water had now stopped coming in and then the well-hole speedily\nbecame empty. But the pumping engine ran on as madly as ever, with a\nwhirr that shook the Holland XI. from stem to stern.\n\nSoon Gilson came running to him.\n\n"Dross is alive," he cried, "and so are most of the others."\n\n"Is Lieutenant Greggs alive?"\n\n"I can\'t tell about him, sir. If he is he was touched pretty heavily."\n\n"Well, do what you can, Gilson. I have no time to attend to them. I must\nstop this machinery or the boat will be ripped to bits."\n\n"Shall I stop the pumping engine. That seems to be O. K?"\n\n"No, for if that power is turned off it will only be added to the screw,\nand we have too much power there already. See how we are flying—as fast\nas an express train."\n\n"That\'s true, sir, and let me add, it\'s not the worst of it."\n\n"No? What do you mean?"\n\n"We are running due East, captain."\n\n"I know that, Gilson."\n\n"By this time we must be within two or three miles of land. If we can\'t\nstop the Holland ',
    'XI.——"\n\n"We must stop her!" ejaculated the young captain. "If we don\'t she\'ll\nstrike shore like a battering ram!"\n\n"Right you are, sir."\n\nOscar waited to say no more, but rushed to where the steering apparatus\nof the submarine craft was located.\n\nThe electricity was still playing all over the compartment, yet he felt\nthat he must at least change the course of the new Holland or all would\nsurely be lost.\n\nWith a rubber glove on his hand he took hold of one of the levers and\ntried to swing it over.\n\nAt first it refused to budge. Then came a snap and a click and the lever\nslid over to where he wanted it and three notches further.\n\nInstantly the Holland XI. gave a shiver from stem to stern and started\nto run in a small circle.\n\nThe engines pounded away as before and the submarine craft tilted until\nit was next to impossible to stand on the floor.\n\nThen came an explosion from the engine room and Captain Oscar was\nenveloped in a blueish smoke which threatened to strangle him on the\nspot.\n\nCHAPTER XXIII.\n\nTHE FIGHT OFF CAPE NOME.\n\n"Captain, are you dead?"\n\nIt was Gilson who uttered the cry, as he rushed forward through the\nsmoke, to where Oscar was leaning against a post, gasping for breath.\n\n"No—no, Gilson," was the answer. "But we—we must have some fre-fresh\nair!"\n\nGilson knew what to do and ran with might and main to where the air was\nstored.\n\nHe turned several cocks and soon the foul air was being forced out of\nthe Holland XI. and fresh air began to circulate through the various\ncompartments.\n\nThis had hardly been done when Oscar heard a voice calling him. Then the\nengineer appeared, as pale as death and with his forehead bandaged.\n\n"Reckon I was knocked out," said George Dross. "What happened?"\n\n"A good many things," answered Oscar. "How do you feel?"\n\n"As weak as a half drowned cat, captain. But what is wrong? Did the\nlightning knock us inside out?"\n\n"Almost," answered the young commander, and told the engineer some of\nthe particulars.\n\n"I\'ll do what I can with that engine," ',
    'said Dross. "But it\'s a ticklish\njob—with so much electricity flying around loose."\n\n"Be careful," returned Oscar. "I don\'t want you to get knocked out for\ngood."\n\nHe followed the engineer to the doorway of the engine room and here a\nlong consultation took place.\n\nThen it was decided that Dross should try to manage one part of the\nengine while Oscar managed another, both at the same time.\n\nIn the meantime the Holland XI. continued to swing around in a circle\nand once the craft came close to throwing herself completely over on the\nstarboard side.\n\n"Now then, ready, George?"\n\n"Yes, captain."\n\n"Then let her go."\n\nBoth strained at their task and several sharp clicks followed. Then\nOscar sprang to a nearby lever and gave it a pull.\n\nInstantly the power was shut off and in a moment more the Holland XI.\ncame to a standstill on the bosom of the ocean.\n\n"Hurrah, we have stopped her at last!" cried Oscar, enthusiastically.\n\nWith the turning off of the electricity it became safe to walk all over\nthe submarine craft and both Oscar and the engineer, as well as Gilson,\nset to work to repair damages.\n\nWhile they were at work the most of the men who had been shocked by the\nlightning came to their senses and wanted to know all about what had\nhappened.\n\nBut poor Andy still lay in a stupor and he did not recover until several\nhours after.\n\nIt was no mean task to repair all the damage done to the intricate\nmachinery of the Holland XI. and for two days every man on board was\nkept busy.\n\nFortunately, however, nothing had been destroyed but the burnt-out\nswitchboard, and luckily there was a duplicate switchboard in the\nstoreroom. Oscar himself put this into place and when tried it worked\nperfectly.\n\n"Now I reckon we are all right once more," said the young commander,\nafter a test had been made of all the working parts of the submarine\nboat.\n\nYet to make certain that he was ready for active service, once again he\nran the Holland XI. out into the ocean and made her go through all ',
    'the\nmovements of blowing up a warship.\n\nThen the course was changed for Cape Nome and soon they were but a few\nmiles from that port.\n\nAn American warship was sighted, but Oscar got no opportunity to hail\nher, for she was steaming along at full speed.\n\n"Looks as if she was running from something," said Andy.\n\nThe American warship had scarcely sailed out of sight to the southeast\nthan the lookout announced a strange craft coming up from the southwest.\n\nThe new Holland was sunk almost to the level of the ocean, so that only\nthe trap deck was above the water.\n\nAt last they made out the newcomer to be a big Russian cruiser, the Ivan\nII.\n\nShe was supposed to be the largest warship in the Russian navy, if not\nin the world.\n\nShe carried a battery of over a hundred large guns and her muster roll\ncounted over two thousand men.\n\n"By jove! but she\'s a wonder!" muttered Andy, as he gazed at her through\na glass.\n\n"She is, and she\'s not alone," answered Oscar. "See two more warships\nhave come into view."\n\nThe young captain was right. The second and the third ships were also\nRussian, and these were followed by a Chinese cruiser and a Japanese\nfrigate, and then came six other Russian vessels.\n\nBy this time the Ivan II. was so close that Oscar thought it best to\ndescend below the surface of the ocean, and coming down with Andy he\ngave orders for the trap-door to be closed.\n\nThe button which communicated with the machinery of the Holland was\ntouched, but, much to the young commander\'s surprise, the trap-door\nremained open.\n\n"Hullo, something is wrong there again!" he cried, and ran to push the\nbutton himself.\n\nIt worked all right, but he speedily discovered that the connection with\nthe power was broken in the engine room.\n\n"We must shut the trap by hand!" he cried to Andy. "Quick, before that\nRussian cruiser spots us!"\n\nThe chums ran up the ladder to move the door.\n\nBut the plate was heavy and ran in a tight groove which was water-proof,\nand for the minute it refused to budge.\n\nSuddenly a yell ',
    'came from the deck of the Ivan II.\n\nThe Holland had been discovered.\n\n"The accursed American sea-devil!" roared the Russian captain. "If she\ngets the chance she will sink us as she has sunk the Tien-Tsin and other\nships."\n\nHe ordered that a bomb be brought on deck with all speed.\n\nThis was done, and a few seconds later the deadly thing was hurled\nstraight at the Holland XI.\n\nIt struck the open trap-door, bumped on the steps, and rolled at Oscar\'s\nfeet.\n\nThe fuse was burning briskly, and in a few seconds more the bomb would\ngo off, creating destruction and death upon every hand!\n\nCHAPTER XXIV.\n\nSINKING OF THE IVAN II.\n\n"We shall be killed!"\n\nSuch was the cry which came from the lips of Andy Greggs as he stared in\nhelpless horror at the bomb, and its smoking fuse.\n\nIt was a moment to act, not to think.\n\nBy instinct more than reason Oscar leaped forward and caught the bomb in\nhis hands.\n\nHis fingers closed over the burning fuse, to put out the fire.\n\nBut the action was too late—the fire had gone inside!\n\nThen with a lightning-like movement the young captain hurled the shell\nup through the trap-door into the air.\n\nBefore it had time to drop into the ocean it went off with a loud\nreport.\n\nPieces of the shell came down through the trap-door, hitting both of the\nyoung men on the head and hands and in the face.\n\nAndy had the skin taken from one cheek and Oscar\'s left hand was\nsomewhat bruised.\n\nBut they and the Holland were saved!\n\nBy this time George Dross was running forward to shut the trap-door with\nan instrument made for that purpose.\n\n"What\'s up?" he asked, in astonishment.\n\n"Shut the trap first and I\'ll tell you," gasped Oscar. For the moment he\ncould scarcely speak.\n\nOnce the trap was closed the new Holland sank down to a depth of thirty\nfeet.\n\nThe movement came none too soon.\n\nThe Ivan II. now had several guns trained on the submarine craft and the\nballs from these struck the water and swept past them with no room to\nspare.\n\n"We\'ll fix you for that!" murmured ',
    'Oscar.\n\nThen he told George Dross of what had occurred.\n\n"Oscar\'s move was the bravest I ever saw!" declared Andy.\n\nThe young captain now ordered that they follow the Ivan II. closely and\nthis was done.\n\nAs expected, the course of the big Russian cruiser was for Cape Nome and\nsoon she came to a stand about five miles from the sea front of the\ncity.\n\n"Now we have her at our mercy," said Andy.\n\nBut for once the young lieutenant was mistaken.\n\nThe foreign ships—or at least a fair number of them—had profited by the\ndestruction of the craft wrecked by the Holland XI. and had adopted a\ncurious device by which they might be warned of the near approach of a\nsubmarine ship.\n\nFrom the under side of the keel of the Ivan II. there ran a number of\nwires, stretching out in all directions, like the spokes of some\ngigantic bicycle wheel.\n\nThese wires were connected with an alarm bell on the ship, which would\nring, by an electric circuit, the moment any large mass of metal touched\nthem.\n\nThe new Holland was going ahead at a fair rate of speed, when, by aid of\nthe searchlight, the lookout announced the discovery of some odd-looking\nwires ahead.\n\nAn inspection was made, and those on board of the submarine craft soon\nlearned the nature of the defensive method the Russian naval officers\nhad adopted.\n\n"That\'s pretty good," mused Oscar.\n\n"I\'m afraid its going to beat us!" declared Andy. "No telling what may\nhappen if we run into those wires."\n\n"They may contain current enough to shock the Holland and kill everybody\non board," said George Dross.\n\nThe matter was talked over for a quarter of an hour.\n\nIn the meantime the other warships had drawn up in line and all were\npreparing to bombard the city beyond, which contained so much of gold\nand silver.\n\n"Well, we\'ve got to do something," said Oscar. "I have an idea."\n\nHis idea was nothing less than to float a torpedo out of the Holland XI.\nand attach it to a long line, setting the time fuse at ten minutes.\n\nThey would then tow the torpedo into such ',
    'a position that the drift of\nthe ocean would pull it under the Ivan II.\n\nThe job was a delicate and dangerous one, for the fuse when once set,\nmight become entangled in the line and set the torpedo off prematurely.\n\nOscar superintended the task himself and in a quarter of an hour the\ntorpedo was drifting close to the Ivan II.\n\nThe guns of the Russian warship had just spoken up against the city\nforts, when the warning bell attached to the wires began to ring.\n\n"Ha! that boat is now at hand!" cried the Russian commander. "We will\nsoon give him more than he sends!"\n\nAn electric current was touched off, but this only struck the torpedo,\nwhich was slowly traveling toward the Russian cruiser\'s keel.\n\nTwo minutes passed and the Russians were wondering what had happened on\nboard of the Holland XI.\n\n"Let the line go!" sang out Oscar, as he saw that the time for the\nexplosion was about up.\n\nThen the new Holland ran for safety.\n\nBoom! Bang!\n\nLoud and clear came the report over and under the ocean, as the torpedo,\ncharged with both high explosives and electricity, went off.\n\nIt would have been impossible to smash up a craft of the size of the\nIvan II. with one torpedo, but a great hole was torn in her keel and\nthrough this the water rushed in a veritable cataract.\n\n"We are ruined!" shrieked one of the Russian officers. "The Holland has\ntorpedoed us after all!"\n\nThen commenced a scene which beggars description.\n\nTo the upper deck rushed the sailors, gunners, ammunition men, engineers\nand all others connected with the big craft.\n\nThere were men cursing, men praying, and men rushing around as if crazy.\nSome leaped overboard, some climbed the tall masts, and some stood as if\nturned to stone, too paralyzed to move.\n\nThose on the other warships were horrified.\n\nThen they realized that the Holland XI. must be at work and the various\ncaptains gave orders to get into motion without delay.\n\nCape Nome and its gold were forgotten. The one thought of all was to get\naway from this frightful ',
    'submarine ship which had brought so many\nforeign vessels to their doom.\n\nOff went the ships, in all directions, putting on their best steam, and\nrunning so well that the Holland did not attempt to follow them until\nsome time later.\n\nSlowly and majestically the Ivan II. sank until reaching the bottom she\nstood where she had gone down, only her tall masts showing above the\nbosom of the ocean.\n\nThe going down of the Ivan II. and the sudden departure of the other\nships mystified those on shore and they wondered what it all meant.\n\nBut when the new Holland showed herself near one of the forts, those\ninside understood and a yell arose, which soon became a ringing cheer.\n\nAs soon as he could Oscar went ashore and was received by the commander\nof the fort, who shook him warmly by the hand.\n\n"You have done nobly, sir!" said the commander. "You have saved both us\nand the city."\n\n"I would advise you to make prisoners of all the Russians found floating\nin the bay," answered Oscar. "It may save you from another attack at a\nlater day."\n\n"A good idea," responded the commander, and at once gave the necessary\norders.\n\nAs a result two hundred and nine Russians were captured, including an\nAdmiral, for the Ivan II. had been the flagship of the fleet.\n\nIt was announced that the Admiral would be held at Cape Nome until the\nend of the war, and this saved the place from another bombardment, for\nthe Russians were afraid the naval officer might otherwise be put to\ndeath.\n\nAfter leaving Cape Nome the Holland put after the rest of the fleet, but\nthey could not be found.\n\nThis broke up the movement on Alaska for the time being, and then the\nbow of the submarine terror was turned southward once more.\n\nAll this time the Chinese Captain, Hang Chang, had remained on board a\nclose prisoner.\n\nHe frequently begged for the freedom of the ship, but Oscar was afraid\nto trust him.\n\n"At least give me a sight of the outside world," he begged one day.\n\nOscar agreed to do this, as they were then in ',
    'mid-ocean, and releasing\nthe prisoner, led him up through the trap-door to the tiny deck of the\nHolland.\n\nThe movement was almost a fatal one. The confinement had preyed on Hang\nChang\'s mind and turning suddenly while on deck, he caught Oscar by the\nthroat.\n\n"We go—we die together!" he hissed, grating his teeth and rolling his\nwicked eyes. "Farewell to the world!"\n\nThe next moment he had leaped into the ocean, dragging Oscar with him!\n\nCHAPTER XXV.\n\nIN WHICH THE HOLLAND XI. IS CAPTURED.\n\n"Man overboard!"\n\nSuch was the cry which came from the lips of Marney.\n\nHe was at the foot of the ladder at the moment Hang Chang grappled Oscar\nand disappeared with the young captain.\n\n"Who\'s over?" came from Andy, as he rushed up.\n\n"The cap\'n!" went on Marney. "The Chink dragged him over! He had the\ncap\'n by the throat!"\n\nAndy waited to hear no more, but bound up the ladder two steps at a\ntime.\n\nAll he could see was a slight disturbance in the water, where a few\nbubbles were coming to the surface.\n\nWith Andy to think was to act, for he felt that Oscar was in a dangerous\nsituation.\n\nWith one leap he was down at the foot of the ladder again and calling to\nGeorge Dross.\n\n"Watch for us! I am after Oscar!" he shouted, and then caught a knife\nwhich was in Marney\'s belt.\n\nThen he went to the deck again and taking a long breath, plunged into\nthe ocean, blade in hand.\n\nIn the meantime Oscar was having a bitter struggle with the madman, for\nsuch Hang Chang had become.\n\nThe grip of the Celestial was like that of steel and could not be\nbroken.\n\nOscar kicked at him and turned and twisted, but all in vain.\n\nThen there came a darkness over the eyes of the young captain and a\nstrange rumble in his ears.\n\nHe felt himself going down and down, the water each instant getting\ncolder and more lonely.\n\n"It must be the end of all!" he thought. "Heaven alone can help me!"\n\nHe thought of the Holland XI., of his friends, of the many victories he\nhad gained—and of what he had hoped to do for the President\'s ',
    'daughter.\n\nWas this to be the end of all—this, a grave at the bottom of the mighty\nPacific?\n\nAgain he struggled, and this time he thought the grip on his throat was\nsomewhat relaxed.\n\nBut only for a moment, then it became even tighter than before.\n\nThe darkness increased and he believed himself dead and dreaming.\n\nOf a sudden something brushed against his shoulder.\n\nIt was Andy\'s body, and opening his eyes he saw dimly a hand clutching a\nknife.\n\nOnce, twice, three, the blade was plunged into the back of the Chinaman.\nThen it came upward a fourth time and slashed across the crazy man\'s\nwrist.\n\nThe sea was died with the blood of the Celestial and slowly but surely\nthat steel-like grip relaxed, until Oscar found himself free.\n\nBut he was almost too weak to help himself and Andy had to assist him to\nthe surface.\n\nHere willing hands helped both to the deck of the new Holland and down\ninto the interior, where both sank on the floor exhausted.\n\nOscar looked white and faint, and not without reason, for never before\nhad he been so close to death.\n\n"We are well rid of him," he said, after he and Andy had told their\nstories. Then he caught his chum\'s hand. "Andy, that is another debt I\nowe you."\n\nFor several days after this nothing unusual happened on board of the new\nHolland.\n\nOscar had now determined to go in search of the Chinese cruiser, which\nwas said to have Martha Adams on board as a prisoner.\n\nHe felt that he must rescue the girl, no matter what the cost, for to\nhim Martha Adams was the loveliest young woman on the face of the globe.\n\nDay after day went by and at last they approached the coast of\nCalifornia once more.\n\nHere a stop was made for provisions and for some extra ammunition, and\nOscar reported to the authorities what had been done at Cape Nome.\n\nBut the news had already come in from Alaska by telegraph.\n\nThe Navy Department at San Francisco also had news for Oscar which\ncaused him much pleasure.\n\nCongress had awarded him and his men a special medal for bravery and ',
    'it\nwas broadly hinted that Oscar would soon be made a commodore.\n\n"We\'ll get to the top of the naval ladder—if this war lasts long\nenough," said Oscar.\n\n"That\'s what we want," answered Andy. He was equally delighted, for he\nscented a captaincy ahead.\n\nFrom San Francisco the run was straight to Central America, and then to\nthe entrance of the great canal.\n\nAt the east end of the canal it was learned that several foreign\nwarships had been sighted in the Caribbean Sea off the south coast of\nCuba.\n\nOne of the warships was supposed to be the Chinese cruiser Green Dragon.\n\n"We\'ll soon find out if it is the Green Dragon," said Oscar, grimly.\n\nBut, alas! just as they wished to crowd on all power, something got the\nmatter with the machinery and they had to lay-to two days for repairs.\n\nIt was very hot, for they were not far from the equator, and so they lay\non the top of the ocean, with the trap-door open day and night.\n\nBy the second night the repairs were almost completed and George Dross\nannounced that they would be ready to continue their voyage by ten\no\'clock the next day.\n\nAll had worked hard over the machinery, especially Oscar and Andy, and\nwere much exhausted in consequence.\n\nThe young captain and his lieutenant retired and were soon in the land\nof dreams, and George Dross, Marney and several others followed, leaving\nonly Walton on guard.\n\nIt was a dark night and so close that it made Walton sleepy. He sat on\nthe companionway ladder smoking, but soon his head began to nod, and\nthough he didn\'t fall asleep he was not as alert as he might have been.\n\nIn the meantime from shore there had put off a long Spanish cutter\ncontaining ten of the most daring Spanish and Italian naval men and\nsailors to be found anywhere.\n\nSlowly and silently the cutter crept up to the Holland XI. and the\nleader of the party, Captain Roquez, stepped on the tiny deck of the\nsubmarine craft.\n\nHe motioned his followers to be silent and then took from his pocket a\nplaster of pitch.\n\nDown the ladder he ',
    'went like a ghost until he stood directly over\nWalton.\n\nThe ammunition-man started in alarm, but ere he could say a word the\npitch plaster was clapped over his mouth and he was made a close\nprisoner.\n\n"Now for the others," whispered Captain Roquez. "We will show the\nAmericanos what we can do and wipe out the insult of the War of 1898!"\n\nSlowly and cautiously the party moved forward until they came to where\nOscar and Andy slept.\n\nThey had brought leather straps along, and these were clapped on the\npair before they could sit up.\n\n"What does this mean?" demanded Oscar, as soon as he could speak.\n\n"It means that we have captured your ship and that you are our\nprisoners!" chuckled the Spanish captain.\n\nCHAPTER XXVI.\n\nPRISONERS ON THE HOLLAND XI.\n\n"Prisoners!"\n\nSuch was the single word which burst from Oscar\'s lips as he tried to\nsit up on his couch.\n\nHe almost thought he was dreaming, but when he tried to raise his arm\nand found it tied fast to his resting place, he fully realized the\ndireful situation.\n\n"And who are you?" he went on slowly.\n\n"Captain Roquez, but not at your service," returned the Spaniard, with a\nbaneful glance. "The Americanos defeated my country in Cuba, years ago,\nbut they shall never defeat me again. On the contrary, I shall have a\nsplendid revenge upon all the Yankee navy—now I am master of the new\nHolland.\n\n"Oscar, this is an outrage," put in Andy, after finding himself also\nbound. He turned to Roquez. "What have you done with the engineer and\nthe others?"\n\n"All prisoners, excepting one man, who slept at the door of the\nammunition room."\n\n"That was Marney, the air man. What of him?"\n\n"He tried to resist, and he is now at the bottom of the sea."\n\n"You killed him?"\n\nCaptain Roquez nodded, coldly.\n\n"And I will kill every one of you if you try to resist me," he added\ngrimly.\n\n"How do you expect to run this boat?" questioned Oscar, curiously. "Do\nyou not know that it takes a well-drilled expert to do the trick?"\n\n"Humph! We are prepared!" said the ',
    'Spaniard. "Rest assured that I knew\nwhat I was doing when I planned to capture the new Holland."\n\n"Well, I\'ll wager a dollar you can\'t run the boat," said Oscar,\ndecidedly.\n\n"Then if we cannot we will force you and your men to run it for us."\n\n"I\'ll see you hanged first!"\n\n"And so will I!" added Andy, promptly.\n\n"Ho! Do not speak so, or I will run you through with this!" cried the\nSpaniard, and flourished a long dagger in their faces.\n\nA moment later Captain Roquez went away, leaving Oscar and Andy in\ncharge of one of the Spanish sailors, Canelli, by name.\n\nCanelli could not speak English, so to converse with him was out of the\nquestion.\n\n"Oscar, this looks as if we were in a pickle," came from the lieutenant,\nwith something of a groan.\n\n"That\'s true, Andy. How are your bonds."\n\n"As tight as a drum. And yours?"\n\n"Ready to cut the wrists and ankles off me."\n\n"They know how to tie knots, don\'t they?"\n\n"They do."\n\n"I wonder how they intend to run the Holland? I don\'t see how they can\nmanage our intricate machinery," went on Andy, musingly.\n\n"They can\'t run her unless they have an expert machinist aboard, and\neven then he\'ll have to know something of submarine boats. If any\nordinary fellow tackles George Dross\' job, he\'ll run us to the bottom or\nblow us up."\n\nCanelli now came forward and clapped his hand on each of their mouths,\nat the same time showing them his knife, upon the blade of which was a\nquantity of dried blood.\n\nThis was a warning to keep silent, and as the Spaniard looked like a\nwicked wretch, capable of doing almost anything, they stopped\nconversing.\n\nHalf an hour went by and all remained silent on board.\n\nThe trap-door was still open, but now of a sudden they heard the\nwell-known click-click as the trap closed.\n\n"Found out how to shut her up, anyway," murmured Andy.\n\nBoth strained their ears to learn what the next movement of the captors\nof the Holland would be.\n\nThey heard earnest talking in the power room, where George Dross lay,\nbound to an iron ',
    'bench.\n\n"Won\'t tell ye a thing, hang ye!" came presently from the old engineer.\n"I run this ship for Cap\'n Pelham, not for the likes o\' you!"\n\n"Good for Dross!" whispered Oscar. "I knew he would stick by us."\n\n"If you won\'t help us we will kill you!" came in Captain Roquez\'s voice.\n\nTo this George Dross was silent.\n\nThen followed pleading and curses, but all to no effect. Finally Captain\nRoquez and another man came out into the passageway in front of the\napartment in which Oscar and Andy were prisoners.\n\n"Gabretti, you must do your best without their help," said the Spanish\ncaptain, earnestly.\n\n"I will, captain," was the answer, in a strong foreign accent. "But it\nwill be taking something of a risk."\n\n"It ought to be all right. You once ran the engines on the old Holland."\n\n"Zat ees true, captain, but ze new Holland is von great improvement on\nze old. Ze machinery ees much more—vat you call heem?—complications,\neh?"\n\n"I suppose so—these accursed Yankees are forever improving things. But\ntheir engineer won\'t do a thing and so you must do your best. Only don\'t\nblow us up as you blew up the old Holland."\n\n"Ha, ha! You make von joke on me, eh? I blow up ze old Holland because\nve vant him blow up. I hate ze Americanos. But I not blow up ze new\nHolland, no, no! I make heem blow up two-seex-ten-a-hundred Yankee ships\nbefore I am done."\n\n"Now you are talking," answered Captain Roquez. "But be careful, and if\nyou can\'t manage her we will force that Yankee engineer to help us out,\neven if I have to cut off his ears to make him come to terms."\n\nThe two passed out of hearing, and presently Canelli was called away,\nleaving Oscar and his first lieutenant alone.\n\n"Andy, that fellow is Gabretti, the rascal who blew up one of the old\nHollands!"\n\n"Right you are, Oscar. He ought to be hung!"\n\n"Rather say, captured. Don\'t you remember that there is a reward of\nfifty thousand dollars out for his apprehension?"\n\n"By Jove, that\'s so! I\'d like to obtain that reward."\n\n"He ought to be captured, the ',
    'sneak! I don\'t believe he can run our\nboat."\n\n"He may run her after a fashion. But sooner or later he is bound to get\ninto a tight hole and then he won\'t know what to do."\n\nHalf an hour more dragged by, and the Holland began to sink by jerks,\nshowing that the man who was running the power was new at the business.\n\nShe descended a distance of fifty feet and came to a stop.\n\nThen the new engineer began to experiment with the power, and moved the\nboat backward with a number of other jerks, and then forward slowly and\nunevenly.\n\n"He\'s trying hard to get there," muttered Andy.\n\n"He can\'t run her smoothly enough to do service with," returned Oscar.\n"Wait, I have an idea!" he added, suddenly.\n\n"What\'s up now?"\n\n"Perhaps I can get free. The edge of this couch is of iron and rough in\none spot, as I well remember. Perhaps I can saw this leather strap apart\non the rough edge. Do you think that Spaniard will stay away?"\n\n"Never mind; do what you can."\n\nWith caution, and making as little noise as possible, the young captain\nset at the task of liberating himself.\n\nIt was a slow and painful job, and he rubbed the skin on his wrists\nalmost as much as he did his leather bonds.\n\nBut the movement was a success, and at last he found his hands free.\n\nHe quickly liberated his feet and then set his lieutenant at liberty.\n\n"Now if only we had pistols," said Andy.\n\n"We will take the electric rifles—they make little or no noise,"\nanswered Oscar. "And don\'t forget those swords in the pantry."\n\nSoon both were well armed and ready to fight to the death for liberty.\n\nHardly had they prepared themselves when they heard footsteps\napproaching the apartment.\n\nOn the instant Oscar reached up and turned off the electric light\nhanging from the ceiling.\n\n"Get in a corner, Andy, and watch your chance," he whispered. "And mind,\nthey are our deadly enemies and would kill us were they certain they\ncould run this boat without our aid."\n\nThere was no time to say more, for a second later the door was ',
    'opened\nand Captain Roquez and the sailor, Canelli, entered.\n\nCHAPTER XXVII.\n\nTHE DEFEAT OF THE ENEMY.\n\n"Ha! It is dark here!" cried the Spanish captain, as he paused on the\nthreshold of the door.\n\n"The light has lost its power," answered Canelli. "Perhaps it got turned\noff by accident."\n\n"Try to find it."\n\n"Aye, aye, captain."\n\nThe sailor came into the room and Captain Roquez followed.\n\nThe instant they entered Oscar kicked the door shut and caught the\nSpanish captain from behind.\n\nAndy caught Canelli, and a fierce hand-to-hand struggle ensued.\n\nDown went both pairs on the floor and rolled over and over.\n\nThey tried to rise, but this was impossible, for the Holland had begun\nto jerk around in a semi-circle, the new engineer having tried some\nexperiment with the power.\n\nThe Spanish captain drew his dagger, but before he could use it, Oscar\nbrought his sword into use and the Spaniard received a nasty cut in the\nside. At the same time Andy was trying to draw his own blade, but\nCanelli caught hold of it, and now it was a wrangle for the blade, hot\nand bitter.\n\n"Do you surrender?" asked Oscar, as he placed the sword at the Spanish\ncaptain\'s throat.\n\n"Yes! Do not kill me!" howled Roquez.\n\n"Then lie where you are. A single move and I will put a bullet into\nyou."\n\nOscar backed to the center of the apartment and turned on the electric\nlight once more.\n\nCaptain Roquez lay helpless on the floor. He knew that if he moved, the\nyoung captain of the Holland would run him through with that\nugly-looking blade.\n\nOscar turned to look at Andy. The sight that met his gaze thrilled him\nwith horror.\n\nCanelli had obtained possession of the sword, and was on the point of\nrunning it through the young lieutenant\'s body.\n\n"Stop!" cried Oscar. "Stop, or I will fire!"\n\n------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n"STOP OR I WILL FIRE!"\n\n------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n"Never! He shall die!" shrieked the Spanish sailor.\n\nAnd he made a ',
    'fierce lunge at Andy, intending to lay open his very\nheart.\n\nThe blade had already cut through the young lieutenant\'s shirt and\nscratched his skin, when Oscar raised the electric rifle with the\nrapidity of lightning.\n\nZip! There was a faint, hissing sound, and Canelli fell over backward,\nmortally wounded.\n\n"Ha! You have killed him——" began Captain Roquez, when Oscar clapped his\nhand over the Spaniard\'s mouth.\n\n"Say another word, or make the least outcry, and I will serve you in the\nsame way!"\n\n"Gosh! but that was a close shave!" gasped Andy, as he staggered\nforward. "I was afraid I was a goner!"\n\n"Hand me that leather strap and I will make this fellow a prisoner,"\nsaid Oscar.\n\nThe strap was quickly adjusted, and then Oscar brought forth a large\nneckerchief, which he speedily transformed into a gag and inserted in\nCaptain Roquez\'s mouth.\n\n"What shall we do with him?" questioned Andy.\n\n"We\'ll put him in the pantry for the present. The dead body we can stow\naway under my couch." For Canelli had breathed his last.\n\nBack of the apartment was a pantry containing flour, potatoes and other\nship\'s stores.\n\nIn this narrow space they placed Captain Roquez, perching the Spaniard\non a flour barrel.\n\n"Now keep quiet if you value your life!" said Oscar.\n\nThen the door was closed and bolted on the rascal.\n\nOscar\'s next movement was to look out into the passageway.\n\n"The coast is clear," he said to his lieutenant. "Come."\n\nAndy followed, and they passed to the entrance to the ammunition room.\n\nHere they found Walton and two other men, close prisoners, each with a\npitch plaster over his mouth.\n\nThere was a Spanish guard here, but he was readily overpowered, and one\nof the pitch plasters was placed over his mouth and he was tied to a big\ntorpedo.\n\n"Where is George Dross?" asked Oscar.\n\nNobody knew.\n\n"So far we are but four against seven," said Andy. "We want to be\ncareful, or our cake will be dough."\n\n"I hope Dross is safe," said Oscar. The old engineer was very dear to\nhim.\n\nHe told ',
    'the men to remain on guard, and each armed himself with a\ndagger, sword or pistol.\n\nThen Oscar tiptoed his way to the engine room.\n\nPeering in he saw Gabretti at the engine, studying a power register with\nmuch perplexity.\n\n"I can make nodding of heem!" he muttered. "Do zat make ze boat go zis\nvay or zat vay, eh?"\n\nHe turned to George Dross, who still lay bound to the iron bench.\n\n"Don\'t ask me any questions," growled the old engineer.\n\n"You shall answer me!" stormed the Italian. "Answer—vot ees zat funny\nclock for?"\n\n"It shows the time to pump the electricity in the\ngo-bang-it-on-the-head," answered Dross.\n\n"Ze electricity in ze go-bang-him—vot you call eet? Who ses eet?"\n\n"It shows when you will be hung," grumbled George Dross.\n\n"Ha! You make von fun of me, eh? You are a—a—I know not vot. How you\nlike dat, eh?"\n\nRaising his heavy boot, Gabretti kicked the old engineer violently in\nthe side.\n\nHe was about to repeat the act when Oscar rushed at him from behind and\npushed him headlong.\n\nThen the young captain of the Holland jumped on the Italian rascal,\nknocking every particle of wind out of him.\n\n"Let—mego!" panted Gabretti.\n\n"Ha! It ees the captain!"\n\n"You scoundrel, to blow up one of the old Hollands!" cried Oscar\nangrily. "You, a naturalized citizen of the United States. You deserve\nwhat you will surely get—a traitor\'s death."\n\nGabretti struggled wildly and tried to draw a knife from his bosom. But\nOscar kicked the blade aside and hit the rascal a blow with his electric\nrifle, and then the traitor sank back, insensible.\n\n"Heaven be praised!" murmured George Dross, when set free. "I was afraid\nwe had reached the end of our string."\n\n"I reckon that fellow has reached the end of his string—or he will when\nhe hangs," answered Oscar. "Bind him with the ropes that bound you." And\nDross quickly complied.\n\nWith the leaders of the expedition against the new Holland out of the\nway, and with five men to fight but six, Oscar rightfully felt that\nsuccess was now but a short ',
    'distance off.\n\nGeorge Dross was soon armed, and then Oscar and the old engineer moved\nsilently toward the lookout.\n\nHere two men were stationed, a Spaniard and an Italian. They were both\ngazing intently at what was before them in the ocean, and neither heard\nthe approach of the Americans until it was too late for them to do\nanything.\n\nBoth were thrown down and in the struggle one was knocked senseless.\nThen the pair were bound, back to back, and pitched into one of the\nlower compartments of the Holland XI.\n\nWhile this was going on two other men had appeared in front of Andy and\nthose with the young lieutenant.\n\nA fierce fight ensued, in which one of the foreigners was shot and the\nsecond cut in the head with a sword. One of the Americans was also\nwounded, but the wound was of small consequence.\n\nHalf an hour later the Holland XI. was once again in complete control of\nher regular crew.\n\nWalton explained how he had been overcome, and Oscar read him a lecture\non being more careful in the future.\n\n"And I will be careful," said the ammunition-man. "After this the first\nman to try any game on me gets shot."\n\nOscar did not care to go after the Green Dragon while he had so many\nprisoners on board, and consequently he ran in at Santiago de Cuba, and\nplaced Captain Roquez, Gabretti and the others in charge of the American\ngarrison there.\n\n"A big haul, Captain Pelham," said the commander of the garrison. "The\ncapture of Gabretti means fifty thousand dollars in your pocket."\n\n"A fair share of it shall go to my men," answered Oscar.\n\nSoon the new Holland left Cuba, and then the search for the Green Dragon\nand pretty Martha Adams was renewed with more vigilance than ever.\n\nCHAPTER XXVIII.\n\nAN UNDERWATER EARTHQUAKE.\n\nFrom Santiago the Holland XI. ran southward and then eastward.\n\nA rainy season was now on, and it was cloudy nearly all the time, while\nshowers were frequent.\n\nA sharp lookout was kept constantly, but for several days nothing was\nsighted but a few peaceable fishing ',
    'smacks.\n\nAt Santiago the young commander had received news that many of the\nforeign nations were growing tired of the war.\n\nOut of sixteen naval battles they had won but four and out of twenty-two\ncontests on land only three stood to their credit.\n\nIn the meantime Uncle Sam had not been idle.\n\nAn army of invasion, numbering forty thousand soldiers, had been landed\non the coast of England and had taken possession of two forts and one\ncity located there.\n\nAnother army was on its way to Japan and a third had just left the\nPhilippines bound for China.\n\nMore than this, the Boers of South Africa had thrown in their fortunes\nwith the United States and Cape Colony had followed. Four small South\nAmerican republics had likewise declared for our country and were\nwilling to do whatever Congress and President Adams wanted of them.\n\n"Things are coming our way fast," declared Andy, when talking the matter\nover with the young naval captain. "I reckon those foreigners who have\ncombined against us are heartily sick of their job. I can\'t understand\nwhy they went in at all."\n\n"It\'s the capitalists who forced the war, Andy. The United States is\ntaking the trade of the world fast, and they had to do something."\n\n"Then why didn\'t they stop buying our goods?"\n\n"Because the common people won\'t stand that—not if they can buy our\ngoods cheaper than they can their own. When you touch a man\'s pocketbook\nyou touch his heart."\n\n"But after this war is ended, what then?"\n\n"We\'ll have to adjust commercial matters with them, that\'s all. Congress\nwill come to some sort of a friendly agreement. After all, you must\nremember that our enemies are really our fellow human beings. While we\nhave the power to do so, it\'s not right for us to drive them too far\ninto a corner."\n\n"I agree with you, Oscar. \'Live and let live\' is my motto. But I must\nsay I\'ve got no use for the Chinese."\n\n"Nor I—especially for the fellows who abducted Miss Adams."\n\n"I see you can\'t get her out of your head. Well, I don\'t blame ',
    'you.\nShe\'s a fine girl, no two ways about it."\n\nThe Holland XI. was now out of sight of land, and no shore came to view\nuntil some hours later.\n\nIn the meantime the air grew strangely hot in spite of the heavy rain\nwhich was falling.\n\n"Gosh, but the Holland XI. is getting to be a reg\'lar sweatbox!" panted\nGeorge Dross, as he came out of the engine room and to the trap-door to\nget a whiff of fresh air.\n\nOscar examined the thermometer.\n\n"Great Scott!" he ejaculated.\n\n"How high?"\n\n"A hundred and eighteen in the shade!"\n\nDross could not believe it and examined the glass for himself.\n\n"Right you are, captain. No wonder I was getting ready to keel over down\nthere from the heat."\n\n"We will sink to the bottom of the sea," answered Oscar. "It must be\ncooler there than up here."\n\nA fresh supply of air was taken on board and soon the submarine craft\nwas slowly descending.\n\nAt this point the bed of the Caribbean Sea lay a quarter of a mile below\nthe surface and was broken up by a series of ridges and several\nhilltops, which looked as if in years gone by they might have been\nislands.\n\n"It is cooler here," said Andy, while they were resting on the bottom.\nAnd then, glancing out of the window, he continued: "What beautiful\nseaweeds and trees! Oscar, do you suppose this part of the ocean was\never an island?"\n\n"More than likely, Andy."\n\n"What caused it to sink—an earthquake?"\n\n"Either that or else a volcanic eruption, such as they had on Martinique\nyears ago."\n\n"That was a terrible thing. I was told it wiped out 30,000 lives at the\ncity of St. Pierre."\n\n"Yes, and it was followed by the sinking of four small islands in that\nvicinity and the appearance of the island now known as Gromley, after\nProfessor Gromley, the geologist, who discovered it."\n\n"Those must have been trying times down here."\n\n"They were—so my father told me. And a few years later, when they had\nthat little earthquake in New York city, and the whole mass slipped two\ninches toward the Battery and the bay, folks got scared out ',
    'of their\nwits. My father told me that downtown people left New York with a rush,\nand some of them didn\'t go back until several months later."\n\n"I don\'t blame them. Imagine the whole city, with its enormously high\nbuildings, coming down with a crash and sliding into the bay. It\'s\nenough to make a fellow shiver from head to foot."\n\n"Something is bound to happen there some day—if they keep on putting up\nthose skyscrapers. Just before we left I heard of a party who was going\nto erect a building one hundred stories high and three blocks long, the\nstreets between the blocks to be bridged over."\n\n"Gosh! That fellow must have money!"\n\n"It was a stock company building, and the shares were to be held by the\ntenants. But I wouldn\'t want to live or do business on the hundredth\nfloor, I can tell you that."\n\nAt this moment word came in from the lookout that he desired to see\nCaptain Oscar at once.\n\nThe young captain lost no time in hurrying forward.\n\n"What is it?" he asked.\n\n"Look there, captain. What do you make of that?" questioned the lookout,\nin return.\n\nCaptain Oscar looked in the direction indicated, which was the top of a\nsmall hill.\n\nFrom this hilltop sand was pouring, accompanied by a peculiar something\nwhich resembled smoke.\n\nFor several minutes both gazed at the extraordinary phenomena in\nsilence.\n\n"That is something new," said Oscar. "I would not mind going a bit\ncloser to investigate."\n\nThe words had hardly left his lips when the sand began to shoot up into\nthe air. Then followed something that looked like smoke and steam, and\nsoon the plate glass of the lookout window became hot.\n\n"It\'s a volcano!" cried Oscar. "I reckon we had better leave this\nvicinity."\n\nThrough the speaking tube he gave orders to George Dross to back the\nHolland XI.\n\nThe screw was just beginning to turn when a dull explosion came to the\nears of all on board.\n\nA rush of sand, mud, steam and fire followed and stones beat a steady\ntattoo on the steel plates of the Holland XI.\n\nSome of the mud and ',
    'stones became entangled in the screw of the\nsubmarine craft and in their hurry to get away from the vicinity the\nboat was run into a forest of seaweed and marine brushwood.\n\nThe whole bottom of the sea was moving and they realized that an\nearthquake was at hand.\n\nThey were caught in the very midst of the awful disturbance and it was a\nquestion whether or not they would get out of it alive.\n\nCHAPTER XXIX.\n\nTHE RESCUE OF JEAN FEVRE.\n\nIt was a moment of extreme peril and nobody realized it more than did\nCaptain Oscar Pelham.\n\nShould the Holland XI. become fast between the rocks and mud now pouring\nforth on all sides the submarine craft would be doomed.\n\n"Turn her and run at full speed!" he shouted. "To port, quick!"\n\nHis order to turn to port was obeyed as speedily as possible.\n\nHe had seen the bed of the sea rising in the opposite direction and the\nmovement came none too soon. A moment later the ground shot high up into\nthe air, carrying huge rocks with it.\n\nHad the Holland XI. been caught in that upheaval she would have been\nthrown two hundred feet above the surface of the Caribbean Sea, to fall\nback a broken and battered mass, with all on board lifeless.\n\nThe commotion under water was now growing rapidly, so that little could\nbe seen, and they had to trust largely to luck as they moved on in an\nendeavor to get away from the ill-fated spot.\n\nOnce the Holland XI. struck a huge mass of mud which had just been\nraised by the earthquake.\n\nIt sent the mass flying in all directions and the lookout window was\ncompletely covered with the stuff, so that next to nothing could be\nseen.\n\n"If we get out of this we can be thankful!" gasped Andy. "Hark to the\nroaring! And feel, the very sides of the boat are getting hot!"\n\nThe young lieutenant was right; the plates were so warm that they were\npositively painful to the touch.\n\nAnd now came a greater explosion than before, and in a twinkle the new\nHolland was caught and turned around and around like a top in a strange\ncurrent created ',
    'by this new volcanic eruption. And, worst of all, the\nboat was sinking.\n\n"We\'re going down into a hole!" shouted one of the ammunition men.\n"Nothing can save us now! We\'ll drop to the bowels of the earth and\nright into that volcano fire!"\n\nHis words were truly startling, and for the moment it looked as if all\non board the submarine craft were losing their presence of mind. Oscar\nran to the engine room.\n\n"Up! up!" he yelled. "And give her all the power possible! It is our one\nchance!"\n\nThe electric engine began to work as never before, and presently their\ndownward course was stayed. Then they arose and Oscar directed they run\nahead as before.\n\nThe mud was still on every side and the water ran hither and thither in\nall directions, carrying seaweed, wood and dead fish with it. The heat\ncontinued, but presently it grew cooler.\n\n"I guess we are going to get out of it, after all," said Andy, mopping\nthe perspiration from his forehead. "But, oh! what an experience! I\nnever want another like it!"\n\n"Don\'t crow until you are out of the woods," said Oscar.\n\n"That was a real volcanic eruption and an earthquake combined, wasn\'t\nit?"\n\n"Certainly—and not a little one, either."\n\n"By no means."\n\nYet in an hour the danger was over and the sea once more resumed its\nnormal condition.\n\nWhen they came to the surface it was much cooler than it had been and it\nwas raining in torrents.\n\nOn every side seaweed was floating about and on the water rested an oily\nsubstance exceedingly disagreeable to the smell.\n\n"What will you do?" asked Andy.\n\n"Put in to shore and find out how bad the earthquake has been," answered\nthe young captain.\n\nIt was no easy matter to locate themselves in the darkness, but after a\nconsultation the course was set and they ran back in the direction of\nSantiago.\n\nWhen they arrived at the entrance to Santiago Harbor they found great\nexcitement. The earthquake had done considerable harm to the shipping\nand several small coast vessels had been completely destroyed.\n\nIn the ',
    'town a number of large buildings had suffered, but no serious\ndamage was done and no lives were lost.\n\nBut a few hours later came in word that the shock had been very heavy on\nthe north coast of Venezuela and that several seaport towns were\ncompletely wiped out.\n\n"I want no more earthquakes," said Oscar. "One is enough."\n\nAnd Andy agreed with him.\n\nTwo days later they left Santiago once more and the search for the Green\nDragon was resumed.\n\nBut day after day went by and nothing was seen of the Chinese warship.\n\n"It looks to me as if we were on the wrong track," said Oscar.\n\n"Do you intend to give up the search?" asked Andy.\n\n"No, no! We must find that ship, and Miss Adams."\n\nOn the following day the lookout announced a ship far away to the\nsoutheast.\n\n"Looks something like a warship and then not exactly like one, either,"\nhe said.\n\n"Perhaps it is a private ship fixed over into a fighting machine,"\nreturned the young captain.\n\nIn less than an hour they came up to within a hundred yards of the\nstrange craft.\n\nNot a soul was in sight and they soon discovered that the ship was a\ncomplete wreck from stem to stern.\n\nThere was a large hole on her starboard side, just above the water line\nand many of her upper guns were missing.\n\n"This is queer," said Andy, as they gazed at the wreck. "What do you\nmake her out to be?"\n\n"A French ship-of-the-line. See, there is the name, Bordeaux, on her\nbow. Do you know what I think?"\n\n"That she has been through a battle?"\n\n"Yes, but not with other ships."\n\n"I don\'t understand, Oscar."\n\n"I think she has been through a battle with that earthquake and got the\nworst of it."\n\n"By Jove! Perhaps you are right!"\n\n"I\'m going to see if anybody is on board."\n\nOscar set up a yell through a trumpet, and then, to increase the sound\nof his voice, added an electric attachment which magnified the voice\nfiftyfold.\n\nPresently a cry came faintly from the wreck and a single Frenchman\nappeared at the rail.\n\n"Safe me! Safe me!" he called ',
    'piteously.\n\n------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n"SAVE ME! SAVE ME!" HE CALLED PITEOUSLY.\n\n------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n"Are you alone?" questioned Oscar, cautiously.\n\n"Yes! yes! All alone!"\n\n"Where is the crew?"\n\n"All drowned by ze great earthquake! Oh, it was terrible, terrible. Safe\nme!"\n\n"This may be a trick to get us on board," came warningly from Andy.\n\n"I don\'t intend to go on board yet, Andy."\n\nThe Holland XI. was run in close to the wreck and the Frenchman was told\nto drop into the water.\n\n"I vill drown!" he wailed. "Poor Jean Fevre has never learned how to\nswim!"\n\n"We will pick you up, never fear," said Oscar, and then the Frenchman\ndid as bidden. In a moment more he was on board. Tears of joy streamed\ndown his face.\n\n"It is so goot to be safed!" he said, brokenly.\n\nIt was now discovered that the French warship was in danger of going\ndown at any moment, and they got out of the vicinity without delay.\n\nSoon the big ship began to sink and a quarter of an hour later she\npassed out of sight forever.\n\nCHAPTER XXX.\n\nTHE LAST BATTLE.—CONCLUSION.\n\nJean Fevre proved to be a queer character. He was something of a French\ndude, and before the war had shone in social circles both in Paris and\nin Washington.\n\nOscar soon learned that the Frenchman knew Martha Adams fairly well, and\nthe Frenchman raved over her beauty. When told that she was a prisoner\non the Green Dragon, he was thunderstruck.\n\n"Zat ees not right!" he cried with a shudder. "Poor la belle a prisoner\nof ze bad yellow men! Too bad! It must not be! She ees no soldier! It\nees—ees, yes, it ees devilish!" And he stamped his boot on the deck.\n\nThen he told Oscar that the Green Dragon was hiding in a bay on the\nCuban coast not ten miles distant. He hated the Chinese, and was\nperfectly willing to see them defeated, so long as Martha Adams was\nrescued, and so long as it did not give final victory to the Americans.\n\nThe new Holland ran at once for the bay Fevre ',
    'mentioned and reached it\nat noon of that day.\n\nSure enough the Green Dragon was there, at anchor, and the people on her\ndeck could be seen plainly.\n\nBringing the Holland XI. to the surface behind a point of land out of\nsight of the Chinese warship, Oscar scrutinized those on the deck with\nhis spy-glass.\n\n"By thunder!" he cried, and dropped the spy-glass.\n\nHe had seen Martha Adams on the deck.\n\nThe girl was trying to escape from the clutches of a Chinese officer,\nwho acted as if he had been trying to embrace her.\n\nSuddenly the girl broke loose and ran to the bow of the ship, which was\npointed out to the ocean.\n\nThe warship had a long bowsprit, and the President\'s daughter made her\nway to the extreme limit of this.\n\n"Come back!" roared the Chinese officer, and ran after her.\n\n"Let me be, or I will leap overboard!" screamed the unhappy maiden, and\nthen, as the officer came closer, she made a dive and disappeared\nbeneath the bosom of the ocean.\n\nBy this time Oscar had caught up one of his pistols.\n\nHis aim was true and the Chinese officer pitched headlong into the\nwater, mortally wounded.\n\nThe officer was an admiral in the Chinese navy, and a howl went up when\nthe fatal shot was fired, and all eyes were turned in the direction of\nthe Holland XI.\n\n"Quick, we must rescue Martha Adams, no matter what the cost!" cried\nOscar. "Will you stand by me, men?"\n\n"We will!" came from Andy and the others.\n\n"Then forward at full speed to where she went down. But take care that\nthe Holland XI. does not strike the young lady."\n\nWord was passed along, and the submarine craft darted over the ocean\nlike a thing of life, keeping her deck above water and the trap-door\nwide open.\n\nOscar stood on the deck, pistol in hand, and beside him was Andy, also\narmed.\n\nSoon the boat was almost under the bowsprit of the Chinese warship.\n\nIn the meantime, Martha Adams had come to the surface and was battling\nbravely to save herself from drowning.\n\nShe could swim, but the weight of her clothes was dragging ',
    'her down.\n\n"Keep up! We will save you!" cried Oscar.\n\n"Help!" panted the girl. "Oh, save me from those horrible Chinamen!"\n\nShe struck out feebly, then disappeared from view.\n\n"Take my pistols, Andy!" exclaimed Oscar, and threw down the weapons.\nThe next instant he was over the side of the new Holland and swimming\nafter Martha Adams. A dive and he had the beautiful maiden by the\nshoulder.\n\nIn the meantime the Chinese were bewildered and knew not what to do.\n\nBut then several officers ran forward with guns and pistols.\n\n"Shoot the foreign dogs!" they shouted, and one fired a gun at Oscar,\nbut the bullet sped wide of its mark.\n\n"Come with me, and I will take care of you," said the young captain of\nthe Holland XI., encouragingly.\n\n"Mr. Pelham!" burst from the girl\'s lips, and a smile lit up her anxious\nface. "Oh, how thankful I am!"\n\n"There is no time to spare! Come, quick!" And he helped her through the\nwater to the new Holland\'s side.\n\nAs they came up out of the ocean, several shots were fired, one of which\ntook effect in Oscar\'s shoulder.\n\nAndy returned the fire, and two other Chinese officers went to their\ndeath, while a third was badly disabled.\n\n"Catch hold of her, Andy!" panted Oscar. And Martha Adams was placed on\ndeck. Then Oscar tried to come up, but was too faint from loss of blood\nto do so.\n\n"Give me your hand!" cried Andy, and hauled him on board. Then all three\nwent below and the trap-door was closed as quickly as possible.\n\nThe movement came none too soon, for the Chinese gunners were already\ntraining their heavy guns in the direction of the Holland.\n\n"Blow her up!" shrieked an officer, in Chinese. "Make dog\'s meat of\nher!"\n\n"Back her, full speed!" yelled Oscar. "Quick, Dross, for our very lives\ndepend on it!"\n\nAnd back went the Holland XI. at full speed, churning up the ocean into\na milky foam.\n\n"Bang! bang! boom! boom!" went the Chinese guns.\n\nAll of the shots but one flew wide of their mark.\n\nOne shot hit the bow of the Holland and glanced off, ',
    'leaving a badly\ncracked plate behind.\n\n"Down we go!" sang out Oscar, and down they did go, and in another\nminute were safe for the time being.\n\nThen the young captain fainted.\n\nWhen Oscar came to his senses he found Martha Adams bending over him and\nbinding up his wound for him.\n\n"You are so brave!" she murmured. "I shall never forget you, never!" And\nshe blushed deeply.\n\nShe, too, was weak, but insisted upon making him comfortable before\ncaring for herself.\n\nOscar found that the submarine craft had run half a mile away from the\nbay in which the Green Dragon was located.\n\nHe ordered the boat back at once, and told Andy to torpedo the Chinese\nwarship.\n\nThis Andy was very willing to do, and inside of an hour the new Holland\nhad added another to her long list of victories.\n\n"And now back to the States to tell the President that his daughter is\nsaved," said the young commander.\n\nOn the trip that followed, nothing of special interest occurred.\n\nThe time passed all too quick for Oscar, who found Martha Adams\' society\ndearer to him than ever.\n\nWhen Chesapeake Bay was gained, important news awaited all on board of\nthe Holland XI.\n\nThe foreign nations had given up the struggle against the United States.\n\n"Hurrah! The war is over!" cried Andy. "And I must say that on the whole\nI am not sorry."\n\n"There is only one cloud which rests upon the nation," said the officer\nwho brought the Holland XI. the news. "President Adams\' daughter is\nstill missing."\n\n"She is not missing—she is found," answered Oscar, and introduced the\nofficer to Martha Adams.\n\nThe news spread like wildfire, and when the new Holland reached the\nPotomac it found a regular flotilla of warships there, ready to do her\nhonor.\n\nCannon boomed, whistles blew, rockets flared, bells rang, and flags and\nbunting were everywhere in evidence. The President and his wife came\ndown to the wharf, in their carriage, and received the girl and Oscar,\nin person, and at the happy meeting the crowd fairly shouted itself\nhoarse. It was a ',
    'fitting end to a most glorious campaign on land and\nsea.\n\n"You have fairly earned your reward," said the President to Oscar. "The\nmoney is yours and you shall be commodore of the new submarine fleet\nwhich is building."\n\nTwo years went by and the great war of all nations became a thing of the\npast.\n\nYet the United States were bound to profit by past experience, and lost\nno time in completing all the warships which had been building.\n\nInstead of three, the government built twelve new submarine boats of the\nHolland pattern.\n\nThis fleet was divided into two squadrons, and Andy Greggs became the\ncommodore of one, and faithful old George Dross the commodore of the\nother.\n\nAnd Captain Oscar, do you ask?\n\nIt was no longer Captain Oscar, then, but Rear Admiral Pelham, commander\nof all the United States submarine craft afloat, a worthy officer and\none to be trusted with any mission, no matter how sacred or how\ndangerous. He was known far and wide as a brilliant inventor and daring\nnavy official. And his pretty wife, Martha, was equally known for her\ngreat beauty and her sweetness of heart. They were happy, and here we\nwill leave them.\n\nTHE END.\n\n*** END OF THE PROJECT GUTENBERG EBOOK THE YOUNG NAVAL CAPTAIN ***\n\nUpdated editions will replace the previous one—the old editions will be\nrenamed.\n\nCreating the works from print editions not protected by U.S. copyright\nlaw means that no one owns a United States copyright in these works, so\nthe Foundation (and you!) can copy and distribute it in the United\nStates without permission and without paying copyright royalties.\nSpecial rules, set forth in the General Terms of Use part of this\nlicense, apply to copying and distributing Project Gutenberg™ electronic\nworks to protect the PROJECT GUTENBERG™ concept and trademark.

In 2001, the Project Gutenberg\nLiterary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure and\npermanent future for Project Gutenberg™ and future generations.

The Foundation’s EIN or federal tax identification number is\n64-6221541. Contributions to the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive\nFoundation are tax deductible to the full extent permitted by U.S.\nfederal laws and your state’s laws.\n\nThe Foundation’s business office is located at 809 North 1500 West, Salt\nLake City, UT 84116, (801) 596-1887. Email contact links and up to date\ncontact information can be found at the Foundation’s website and\nofficial page at www.gutenberg.org/contact\n\nSection 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary\nArchive Foundation\n\nProject Gutenberg™ depends upon and cannot survive without widespread\npublic support and donations to carry out its mission of increasing the\nnumber of public domain and licensed works that can be freely\ndistributed in machine-readable form accessible by the widest array of\nequipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations ($1 to\n$5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt status with\nthe IRS.\n\nThe Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating\ncharities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United\nStates. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a\nconsiderable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up\nwith these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations where\nwe have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND\nDONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular state\nvisit www.gutenberg.org/donate.\n\nWhile we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we\nhave not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition\nagainst accepting ",
    "unsolicited donations from donors in such states who\napproach us with offers to donate.\n\nInternational donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make any\nstatements concerning tax treatment of donations received from outside\nthe United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.\n\nPlease check the Project Gutenberg web pages for current donation\nmethods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other ways\nincluding checks, online payments and credit card donations. To donate,\nplease visit: www.gutenberg.org/donate.\n\nSection 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg™ electronic works\n\nProfessor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project Gutenberg™\nconcept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared\nwith anyone. For forty years, he produced and distributed Project\nGutenberg™ eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.\n\nProject Gutenberg™ eBooks are often created from several printed\neditions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in\nthe U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not\nnecessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.\n\nMost people start at our website which has the main PG search facility:\nwww.gutenberg.org.\n\nThis website includes information about Project Gutenberg™, including\nhow to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive\nFoundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to subscribe to\nour email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.\n",
